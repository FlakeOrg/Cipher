# Contributing
Thank you for willing to contribute! The way to contribute depends on the following. Please read below:
## Rules about contribution
* Read the story first. Don't make a change so drastic it alters the story.
* You may open a pull request that isn't based on an issue, but it may not be accepted.
* The rules for making content apply to contribution.
* Contributions **must be only code.** Models or art will not be accepted unless you are part of the team.
* Whether or not you appear in the credits is up to you. If you choose to do so, you have to tell us how to name your or we will use your Github username.
* **YOUR PROFILE WILL BE REVIEWED. IF YOU MAKE GRAPHIC THINGS, WHETHER IT'S OUTSIDE THE STORY OR NOT, YOUR PULL REQUEST WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED AND YOU WILL BE BANNED FROM CONTRIBUTING.**
### One time contribution
If you are contributing only one time and not joining the team, do the following:
* Open a pull request
* State whether you want to be in the credits or not
* State the issue
### Joining the team
If you are joining the team:
* Contact me
* Say what position you want to enter
* Show me at least some proof that you know how to make things.
* If you are applying for artist, show me a speedpaint of one of your arts so I know you are not AI generating anything.
* **Just because you apply doesn't mean you will get accepted. Don't argue with me about my decision.**
