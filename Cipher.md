## Chapter 1: Cruise

2024 July 24th

Mello was on a cruise; he was going back to Seattle, and currently, he was drinking a soda and relaxing in the night. Often, the crew would make an announcement at every hour of the current activities going on. This time, 10 PM, they did not. Mello didn’t think it was very concerning; he heard a lot of drama going around the cruise and the crew was probably just trying to stop the drama. Another half hour came by. 
“...that’s odd.”
Mello eventually got anxious enough to start walking to the front desk to ask about this. Something happened. Suddenly, alarms went on and asking people to run to the lifeboats immediately. It was too late. The cruise hit a giant rock in the middle of the ocean and Mello was flying out the window. He went into the ocean and drowned...right?

 
## Chapter 2: Hospital
At the same time that this happened, in Seattle, Clove was in a mental hospital. He really thought nothing was wrong with him, and he was right. Nothing really was wrong with him. Even though the events that led to him being here happened, he somehow didn’t have PTSD or trauma. He honestly thought that this was all just a prank because of what he thought. For some reason, whenever he went to tell the doctors that he was fine and he could go now, they always denied it. Are they telling the truth? Can they just not understand sign language? Why am I still here? Clove often thought these questions. One day, the hospital told them to follow instructions from an agency. Clove did NOT trust them at all. He waited until he was on ground level and then jumped out of the window and started running. The “agency” started holding what looked like guns and that made him run even faster. They are NOT helping me. Eventually, he finds an open storage unit and hides in it.

 
## Chapter 3: Chase
A month after the crash, Mello woke up. Why the hell did he wake up? Am I dead? Why am I breathing? He looked around... and he realized his skin was purple. He realized he had a tail. He looked like an eel, but more humanoid. He started swimming up to the surface and saw the Space Needle. He was in Seattle, but how would Seattle react to him? He put on his hood (he was wearing a hoodie when he “drowned”) and tried to hide his tail as best as possible. He gets on the sidewalk and starts walking around. People didn’t seem to notice, they didn’t see that he has purple skin/scales and an eel tail. That was surprising. Eventually, the same agency (the one that chased Clove) starts to stare at him suspiciously. Mello honestly looked really shady, he tried to walk faster, but he realized he was being followed by the agency. He starts running. They start running. What are they chasing me for??? He makes a sharp left and enters a storage unit place, he loses them and hides in a storage unit. Clove was in the same unit at the time. He looked at Mello like he saw a ghost.
“Who are you” Clove said in ASL.
“Mello”
Clove looked suspicious of him, he never knew a teenage boy like him could become half eel.
“Why do you look like that” Clove signed.
“I don’t know”
 
## Chapter 4: Hide
About 5 minutes after questioning later, people running around the unit could be heard.
“Do you know those guys?” Mello asked verbally.
“No. They chased me too.” Clove signed
“Why?”
“I didn’t comply with their ‘friendly’ instructions”
The running got louder.
“They’re probably coming” Mello said.
“Follow me” Clove signed
Clove led him to a hole in the ground, covered by several boxes.
“Why the hell is there a-”
Clove glares at Mello, then jumps down into the hole. It was kind of big. Mello also jumps in. Clove covers the hole with the same boxes and turns on a small lamp inside the hole.
A minute after they got in, they could both hear the storage unit opening. Clove doesn’t seem very scared; this happens weekly to him. He peeks out of an even tinier hole to see what’s going on in the storage unit.
“Search the perimeter.” The leading guard says.
The rest of the guards start looking around the storage unit. One of the guards is about to pick up the boxes covering the hole
“Peek through here and tell me what’s going on” Clove signed as he holds down the boxes that the guard is about to pick up. Mello does what he asks and peeks through the hole.
“...they’re searching your toolbox” Mello says.
Clove looks slightly irritated by that, but he doesn’t do anything about it.
“They’re starting to get closer to the peephole...” Mello says as he moves out of sight from the peephole. The guard peeks through the peephole and only sees pipes.
“Nothing here.”
“He’s probably somewhere else. Cmon.” The chief says.
Every guard runs out of the door and goes to their car.
Clove moves the boxes out of the way and gets back up to check his toolbox. Mello does the same.
“Cmon, we gotta go get a new wrench.” Clove signs.
“Now?”
Clove opens the storage unit and begins to walk to the store. Mello puts on his hood and starts to follow him.
 
## Chapter 5: Store
“Where is this store?” Mello asks.
“It’s a block away.” Clove signs.
Eventually, they enter the store. It seemed like it hadn’t had maintenance in years. The only other person who was there was the cashier, who seemed like a teen who needed extra money and volunteered. Clove grabs some stuff and goes up to pay for it.
“...you again? How many times do you lose your stuff?” The cashier says as he scans the items
“a lot.” Clove signs. He gives 20 dollars, grabs the change and starts heading to the door.
Mello follows Clove. Right as they were going to touch the glass door it immediately shattered.
“What the-”
“Oh yeah, the doors are broken, some idiot pushed it too hard. Use the windows.” The cashier said.
Clove climbs out the window like it happened regularly. Mello did too. They both start walking back to the storage place.
“That was fast.” Mello said
 
## Chapter 6: Crowd
On the way back, Mello looks at an electronic billboard. It shows a wanted poster of Mello and Clove, saying that if they got caught, the helper would get 100,000 USD. It’s even displaying exactly what Mello and Clove were doing in real time.
“Uhhh, dude?”
Clove looks at him annoyed.
“We might have a bounty on us...” Mello says while pointing at the billboard.
Clove looks up at the billboard. Then around him. Everyone around them was looking at them.
Eventually somebody ran towards them. Then another person did, then another, until all of the crowd were running towards them.
Clove and Mello started to run. Mello’s hood fell off, but at this point he didn’t care.
“Where the heck are we going to go to?”
Clove started to sign so fast Mello couldn’t understand it, Mello pretended to understand.
“...yeah, okay...?”
Somebody in the crowd was running so fast they were right behind Mello and Clove. 
Holy crap this guy needs the money.
He tried to dive forward to grab Mello, but Mello threw a trash can at him, and he tripped.
Clove and Mello took a turn into an alleyway and started going up the fire escape. Someone from the agency shot a syringe onto Mello, it seemed to take a small sample of blood from Mello, Mello took the syringe off him and tossed it onto the ground.
“Now what?” Mello asked
Clove started jumping onto different apartment blocks, Mello followed him.
Eventually, Clove grabbed onto the drone that was showing their exact location and what they were doing and stomped on it.
“Should be easier to lose them now” Clove signed
Mello ran up to him.
“Where do we go from here?”
Clove pointed into the direction of the storage units and started running to it. He climbed down the fire escape with Mello and ran back to the storage unit.
 
## Chapter 7: Opportunities
While Clove and Mello ran back to the storage units and the crowd goes absolutely wild trying to find the two, someone from the agency came back to where Mello dropped the syringe. He picked it up and examined it. After taking a good look at it, he started to walk away. He took a specific path and eventually went to the same store that Clove bought a wrench in. He grabbed a 1-inch screw and went to the cashier.
“Hi, I would like to buy this for my shelf” he says.
The cashier presses a button underneath the desk he was on, and just like that, a secret entrance behind him opens. The person walks in. He brings the sample onto a tray and goes to the teen intern’s office and grabs the microphone for the speaker.
“Starting today, you will all be trying to replicate this sample that I have.” He holds the sample into the air. “The first person to complete this task will be promoted to an official worker at this group.”
A girl named Litz looks up almost immediately at the word “promoted”. She really needs the promotion and is already planning how she will do this.
Another intern, Lisa, looks up at the announcer but isn’t planning on doing any work. They need the job but aren’t looking forward to working on it.
Every other intern (about 15 in total) is listening.
“Everyone will get a small but manageable sample to work with. These will be distributed shortly within 10 minutes.”
10 minutes pass by, and everyone has a sample. Litz seems to be doing the most work out of all the interns, even skipping break time to analyze and replicate the sample.
The next week, Litz starts working on replicating the sample. She looks away from the sample for a moment to check her notes and make sure everything is in order.
Lisa, however, sneaked into Litz’s lab and tried to take the sample, which needed a couple more finishing touches. Litz notices in time and stares at Lisa.
“Put. That. Down.” Litz says menacingly.
Lisa seems to be getting ready to run away. Litz takes one step closer to Lisa.
“If you take one more step towards me, I will report-”
Litz dives straight towards Lisa before she could even finish her sentence. Lisa dodged, but Litz grabbed onto her foot, making her trip and drop the sample. Litz tries going for the sample but gets dragged back by Lisa.
“That sample is MINE.” Lisa says while lunging towards the sample. She grabs it and tries to run back to her lab, but Litz tackles her. She drops the sample again, but it breaks and half of the sample splashes onto Litz.
Lisa runs away. Litz tries to pick up the remaining bits of the sample with a dropping pipette and luckily gets the remaining of it without the bacteria on the ground screwing it up.
“...no big deal, I can just replicate it with this....”
Litz goes back to work.
 
## Chapter 8: Planning
While Litz is at work, Clove and Mello have been in the same storage unit they used to be in. Clove is welding something while Mello is trying to come up with a plan to gather more information from the agency.
“You said you had the lab map, right?” Mello asked.
Clove throws the map to Mello without looking at him while welding what seems to be a propeller blade to other junk.
“Thanks.”
Mello grabs the map and starts thinking of how to gather files. After a while of staring at the map and daydreaming about the possible scenarios that could happen, he gets an idea of how to get files. The only thing that was left was to find the entrance. After a couple of minutes of sitting down on a stool and thinking, he finally spoke up.
“The store is the entrance.”
Clove stopped welding, took off his mask and looked at him like he said 2 + 2 = 5
“You’re joking” Clove signed.
“Nope.”
“Until you prove it, I’m not believing you.”
“Fine” Mello said as he stood up and walked out of the storage unit.
He started walking towards the store, putting his hood and normal disguise on. He noticed how much the agency really wanted him; there were wanted posters talking about him EVERYWHERE he turned. Eventually he arrives at the store.
“Hello.” The cashier said without taking his eyes off his phone.
“Hi.” Mello said as he walked around pretending to look at the stuff around. He puts this tiny camera in a hidden spot pointing at the cashier. He touches the door, and it shatters like last time.
“Use the window.”
“...right.” Mello says as he climbs out the window. He walks back to the storage unit and enters it. He puts up a tiny display of what is going on in the camera. Clove stops welding again and looks at it while sipping some soda.
“You sure it’s going to happen?” Clove signs
“Trust me”
After about 5 minutes later, a worker really did show up and the door opened. Clove almost spits out his soda.
“Told ya” Mello said.
 
## Chapter 9: A mild cold.
A day after Mello showed Clove the video, Litz woke up from her apartment. Today was the day she was going to turn in the sample. She got out of bed, got the sample out of a safe and went to go brush her teeth. She felt like she caught a cold, she didn’t worry about it since a lot of people have a cold in Seattle often, so she ignores it and takes a bit of medicine. She looks into the mirror; her skin looks green-ish.
“What the...”
She puts the sample back in the safe and texts the boss saying she is sick and needs to stay home. She gets some breakfast and spends the rest of the day on her couch.
The next day, she looks into the mirror again. Her skin looks greener. She can also see a small but noticeable tail growing, like Mello’s. She takes a sample of blood from herself and looks at it through the microscope. It looks very similar to Mello’s sample. She texts the same thing to her boss and rests.
The next day she was the same form as Mello, having green skin and a tail.
“I can’t stay another day... people are going to catch up.”
She puts on a mask and her same glasses, but this time over sizes her lab coat so that she can hide most parts of her new appearance. She gets out and walks to the same store.
“Hi, I’d like to buy this for my-”
The cashier doesn’t even care and just opens the door without question. Litz walks into the lab and locks it with the sample and gives it the finishing touches for about a couple of hours. Eventually, the sample is complete, and she gives it to her boss.
“Thank you. For now, we will make sure that this sample is the same as the beginning sample.”
Litz goes back to her lab and flops onto her chair.
It’s done...
She looks into the mirror again. She’s still green.
...and I might be done for as well...
 
## Chapter 10: Lab heist
Clove sets up a communication device at a cafe while Mello walks to the store with an earpiece 
“Ready?” A robotic voice says through the earpiece.
“Honestly no.” Mello says.
He walks through the broken window, then pretends to look around the shop. He then goes to the cashier.
“Hey, there’s a spill in aisle 4”
“…man, not again...” The cashier walks over to the storage closet and grabs a mop. Mello quickly presses the button under the desk and walks through the secret door.
“That was easier than I thought...”
“Yeah, but the next will be harder.” Clove says through text-to-speech.
Mello walks through the hallway.
“Remember, you’re in a fake lab coat and everyone else is in a real lab coat. There will definitely be someone pointing that out if you go in a crowd.”
Before Mello opens the door to the main room, he asks something.
“You said you can only interfere with one camera at a time, right?”
“Yeah”
“Can you see through cameras?”
“Yeah, why?”
“How much people are in the main room.”
Clove types on the keyboard for a second.
“5, they seem distracted.”
Mello opens the door and walks through a hallway. He makes a right and he’s in the archives.
“Grab as many as possible.”
Mello pulls out his backpack and starts shoving files from the shelves into his backpack. After about 50 files in his bag, he walks out.
“Okay, that’s the physical files. Now we need the digital ones. The server room should be about 3 doors away.”
“Anybody in the server room?”
“Nobody.”
“This is easier than I thought.”
He enters the servers.
“Okay, just plug the usb in.”
Mello plugs in the usb. It starts a progress bar on the monitor. It increases rapidly.
“What does it do?”
“Just copies every file. Be quick, it might trigger an alarm.”
Eventually it reached 100. Mello took out the USB, and the minute he did, alarms started blaring across the hallway. Mello sprints down the hallway.
“Take a right.”
Mello takes a right and immediately bumps into a scientist, their mask drops.
“Ah frick I’m so-” Mello looks up. He’s shocked.
It’s Litz. She looks 2x more shocked than Mello.
“...”
“...”
Litz puts her mask back on. She can hear the guards approaching Mello.
Mello didn’t really have time to chat. He just ran to the exit. He opened the secret door again and bumped into the cashier while running out the door.
“Use the-”
Mello doesn’t care and dives through the door while it shatters and runs away. 
He goes to the cafe, which was where Clove was monitoring him.
“Got the stuff?” Clove signed.
Mello holds up the bag. “Yup.”
They both walk back to the storage unit. When they arrive, they see a small paper on the desk. Mello looks at it.
“The nearby cafe. 9 PM.”
 
## Chapter 11: Cafe.
Mello walks to the empty cafe with a black hoodie, same as Clove.
“I’m telling you man; this is a bad idea.” Clove signs
“They can’t detain us there, it’s too public.”
“They’ll find a way.”
sigh. “Okay, well, just stay a couple of stools away from me and whoever’s meeting me.”
Mello enters the empty cafe and sits on one of the stools. Clove enters a minute later and sits on a stool about 5 meters away from Mello.
Eventually, someone does enter. They’re wearing long leather oversized jacket, sunglasses, and a hat. They sit down next to Mello.
It’s Litz.
“Dude, what’s with the shady outfit” Mello asks
“I’m in the same state and form as you.”
“Yeah, but just wear a hoodie, whatever outfit you’re wearing is gonna draw attention”
“Okay, well, that’s not the point. Remember that syringe thing they shot at you when everyone was chasing you?”
“Yeah?”
Litz takes off her mask and sunglasses.
“Yeah, that’s what made me similar to you.”
“I’m not responsible for that.”
“Yeah, you aren’t. Here’s the thing.”
She slides over a report of absences in the lab.
“They’re gonna find out about me. You need to somehow blow up the lab.” Litz says.
“Wait, like now?”
Litz nods.
Mello thinks for a moment.
“How are you going to help?”
“I’ll guide you somehow without entering the lab.”
“Hey, Clove, come over here for a second.”
Clove walks over.
“She’s gonna help me do an unexpected mission. Lead her to the storage unit.”
Clove seems confused.
“Why her?”
“We can’t leave someone behind.”
Clove reluctantly asks Litz to follow him.
“Thanks.” Mello says
“Oh, and by the way...” Litz hands him a keycard. “...you’ll need it.”
 
## Chapter 12: Demolition
Mello walked back to the same lab Litz works in. Litz and Clove arrive at the storage unit and start talking to Mello with an earpiece.
“Just cause something that will make me transfer.” Litz says.
“The thing I have in mind is gonna be crazy, do you need to save anything?”
“...what?”
Mello walks in the store. The cashier is gone. He doesn't suspect anything of it and presses the button. He walks in the lab.
“Seems as if they are working overtime, a lot of people are still there.” Clove’s text-to-speech said.
Mello walks through the hallway and opens the door. Nobody is at the entrance.
“Are they in their labs?” Mello asked.
“At this time, yes.”
Mello walks around the building. “Where do they keep the acid?”
“Take a left.” Clove says.
Mello turns left and opens the door with the keycard Litz used. He grabs a test tube and walks out with it.
“Where’s the electrical room?”
“The door next to the chemical room.”
Mello opens it.
“Okay, Litz, last chance. Are you sure you don’t want to save anything?”
“...no?”
“Are you sure?”
“Yes.”
Mello pulls the fire alarm and dumps the acid onto the electrical boxes and generator. He starts running to the exit.
“How much time do I have?”
“20 seconds until the electricity fries up and the building explodes. Make it count.” Clove said.
Mello is dashing to the exit. Luckily, he sees everyone else running away, so he knows nobody is gonna die here. He dives out the secret entrance and starts running away. When he’s a block away from the shop, it explodes.
KABOOM.
Mello runs back to the storage unit.
“Nobody died, right?”
“Nope.” Litz says as she walks back to the apartment. “I’ll help with your mission now, good work.” She says as she drops a sticky note with her phone number on it.
 
## Chapter 13: Wave
1 AM

The guards hand Wave a paper of Mello and Clove. Wave picked it up.
“You want me to capture an eel boy and some mute blonde?” Wave asked.
“Yeah, it should probably be easy with your eagle wings.”
Wave looked outside.
“When?”
“Around 11 AM. Any time around there.”

Meanwhile, Mello and Clove were looking at the files that they stole.
“Why do they need this many files?” Mello said while organizing the files.
Clove shrugged. He looked at the agency’s file
Holy crud we’re dealing with the FBI...
They heard something outside the storage unit. Clove turned off the lamp and got into the hole. Same with Mello.
Mello plugged in the same USB that he used to collect digital files, then went to look at his file.
“So that’s why I’m an eel now...”
Clove stood up and walked to the computer.
Eventually, 11 AM came around. Clove, Mello, and Litz were walking around the shore.
“So, you’re telling me that the reason why you’re an eel is because you got radioactive waste dumped on you?” Litz asked.
“I guess so. It said that.” Mello said.
Mello eventually got the feeling that something was off with Litz.
Meanwhile, Wave was watching the three from a tree while getting her wings ready.
“What the heck? Why is Litz following them? Did she get captured as a hostage???” Wave got up from the branch and started flying up. “She was at the new lab today! She must be held captive!”
Wave immediately swooped down, with Mello and Litz immediately dodging to the side. Clove got caught by Wave.
“Don’t worry Litz! I-” She saw her green skin and tail. 
“...is she betraying us??? She’s betraying us!” Wave felt a little agitated. Instead of going down to get her, she went back to the agency.
Mello ran to the direction of where Wave was going. He tripped in the first 5 steps and landed on the sand.
“Ah frick, how the heck are we gonna get back without getting caught?” Mello mumbled to himself.
 
## Chapter 14: Ghost Kitty
Mello and Litz swam back to another shoreline.
“Maybe she won’t see us here.” Mello said as he stood up and dried himself off.
“Maybe.” Litz started walking back to the lab.
“Where are you going? Wave already saw you. She’s most likely going to tell the chief or whatever”
“She doesn’t have the authority to launch an investigation. EspeciaIlly on someone else. Besides, if I don’t get back on time, they are going to get suspicious.”
Litz walks away, out of sight. Mello decides to walk to the storage unit again.

Mello arrived at the storage unit 30 minutes later. It’s kind of lonely now that Clove isn’t there drinking his soda. He pulled out his phone and typed to Litz.
hes is in the same lab you go to right
Mello waits. After some time, his phone buzzed again.
yes
Mello started grabbing every file that mentions the lab that Clove is in. He then spread it out on a table that Clove usually uses to make blueprints. After about an hour of reading through the files, something moved from his bag. Mello looks at it.
Nothing moves.
He looked back at the files, and then heard his bag move again. Mello looks back at the bag. He slowly walks out of his chair and to the bag. It moves again. Mello unzips it slowly and peeks inside.
It’s a white kitty. It looked up at Mello.
“What are you doing here???” Mello said as he puts the bag down for the cat to crawl out.
The little kitty crawled out of the bag. It started to float around the room. Mello noticed it was transparent too.
“What the heck?”
Mello took out his phone and video called Litz. After a couple of calls, she picks up.
“What is it” She was clearly in the middle of something.
“What the heck is your cat doing?” Mello says as he points the camera at the cat.
“...oh, that thing. It’s harmless, and it’s not my cat.” Litz says. “Gotta go.” She hangs up.
Mello puts the phone in his pocket and looks at the cat. It’s circling around the light bulb. Eventually, it phases through the wall.
“Wait, what the-”
It brings back an empty small box. It sets it down on the map. Then it sits inside it.
Mello just decides to ignore it for now and look at the map. He made a bit of notes, until eventually, after he wrote what he thought was an entrance on a sticky note, the cat meowed.
“Hm?”
The cat taps on a different part of the map, which shows the lab.
“Yeah, that’s where experiments happen, what about it?”
The kitty flies through the wall.
“Oh, he’s gone.” Mello said as he looked back at the map.
Eventually, after 5 minutes, the kitty flew back to the storage unit. It was carrying something. It places it down on the table. Mello picked it up.
It was a photo of a hidden door.
“Holy crud dude thanks.”
The cat meowed again. Then it slept in the box.
Mello was writing down where they should go for the plan.
After 30 minutes, Litz opened the storage unit door.
“What are you doing?”
“I’m planning.”
Litz looked at the map.
“No way, there’s about ten guards in the path you’re going. You have to go through here.” Litz said while writing down a new path.
“But that makes a dusty trip in the vents...”
“Well, would you rather battle some dust in a vent or 10 guards?”
“Fine.”
 
## Chapter 15: Prison.
While this was all happening in the storage unit, Clove was in some jail cell, sitting on the top bed. It was kind of odd, there were so much people around him that were his age. What could they have done to even be here? The girl underneath him was sleeping, while Clove was already inspecting his cell. He was already planning on escaping. Eventually, it became 12 AM, which is lights out. The lights turned red.
Clove got out of his bed once he made sure there was no guards. He could tell the girl wasn’t actually sleeping, but he decided to ignore it. He looked around his surroundings, taking in everything that was in his cell. All he had was a paperclip, a broken wire, and a sheet of metal. He couldn’t work with that.
He climbed back into bed and actually went to sleep.
The next day, 6 AM, he got breakfast, and it was free time. Everyone else was either talking or playing with a deck of cards. Clove wasn’t doing that. He was cleaning up, trying to find other stuff he could work with. The girl from before seemed to be watching him. She was leaning against a wall and looking at him. Clove looked at an electrical box, it was open. Nobody was looking. Other than the girl. He inspected the wires. One of the wires wasn’t doing anything. He thought it was for the red lights when everyone was supposed to be sleeping. He yanked the wire out of the box, closed it, and ran away.
12 AM came around again. This time the lights didn’t turn red. They shut off completely. It seemed like the entire building ran out of electricity. This was Clove’s chance. The doors are electrically locked, but since there’s no electricity, they automatically unlocked. Clove opened the door silently and ran out.
“There’s no way they don’t do anything about it. I have at most a minute to get what I need.”
He ran into the storage room. He headed towards the technical parts. He immediately scrambled to get everything he needed into his pockets.
“20 seconds left.”
He grabbed some materials, including wires, a motor, and a scredriver.
“10 seconds left.”
He sprinted back to his cell, trying to avoid the guards. He ran into the cell, put his materials underneath his blanket, and pretended to be asleep. The red lights went back on. Some kids seemed to be raiding the cafeteria while he was gone. The guards caught them and brought them outside the room. Clove was about to go to sleep, but ghost kitty phased through the wall.
“What the-”
It dropped a note and pencil. Clove picked it up.
We’re coming to get youuuuuu
Clove wrote a message back. Ghost kitty brought it back to Mello
 
## Chapter 16: Another plan.
Mello was prepared, he brought... only his hoodie and backpack with ghost kitty in it. It’s hard to prepare when you have a 100K bounty on you.
“Ready?” Litz said through the ear piece. She is still at the storage unit.
“I think.” Mello said, he is in front of the lab that Litz works in.
“Now or never.”
Mello ran into the lab. There was no disguises, he would have to do everything fast.
“Make a right, the left hallway has guards.”
Mello turned right.
“There’s a door with keycard scanner, I can’t open it.”
Ghost kitty flied away and then came back with a rusty keycard.
“Seriously, where the hell do you find this stuff???”
Mello opened the door and ran inside. It has all of the cells.
“Okay, Clove is in cell B12 and you need to bring him outside. I can open the outside door, but you need to go get Clove.” Litz said.
Mello ran past the cells. A lot of people were looking at him and some were trying to snitch on him to the cameras, but Litz blocked the cameras.
Clove had some invention he made that had 4 handles and a propeller. Mello opened the door. Clove ran out of the cell and to the outside.
“What is that you have there?” Mello asked.
Clove turned it on and stood on it. It started to fly like a drone. Clove pointed at the drone.
“Get on.”
Mello got on hesitantly and it started to fly away. It went REALLY HIGH.
“Holy crud man you sure this is safe?” Mello asked
Clove shook his head. It started to go over T-Mobile park.
For some reason, the lights turned off at T-Mobile park, and turned into red lights. The PA turned on at the park.
“This is an emergency announcement from the white house of the United States. If you look above you, you can see that there is an aircraft above you. This aircraft contains two fugitives. Mello and Clove. Whoever returns the two fugitives gets a prize of 1 million dollars.”
Clove was looking at the stadium incredulously. Not even 30 seconds after the announcement came, there were already shots being fired at Clove’s drone. One of them hit a propeller. The drone started descending.
“WHAT THE HECK??? WE HAVE TO LAND!” Mello said frantically.
Clove grabbed the controls to the drone and tried to control it. Nothing was working.
“We have to skydive.” Clove signed calmly.
“WHAT???”
Clove grabbed 2 parachutes he made out of prisoner uniforms he found in the laundry room, gave one to Mello, and started skydiving to the ocean. Mello hesitantly jumped and followed Clove.
“WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?!?” Litz shouted through the earpiece.
More shots tried to fire at Clove and Mello. Clove didn’t seem scared at all. He was above the ocean and pulled his parachute cord. Mello waited a little bit then pulled the cord too.
They landed in the water safely, the helicopter tracking them seemed to have lost them, Clove took out a pocketknife and cut the parachute strings. Mello just bit the strings off one by one.
 
## Chapter 17: Bomb Cyclone
Mello and Clove walked out of the shoreline and into the land. Litz took a bus stop to Klahanie while Mello and Clove walked to Klahanie. Litz arrived with Mello and Clove.
“I’m surprised they tripled the bounty.” Litz said.
“Wait, what?” Mello said.
She pointed at a wanted poster. It had a 3M bounty of Mello and Clove.
“Sigh Whatever, let’s just find a spot to stay in.” Clove signed. He walked away from the poster with Mello and Litz.
Litz’s phone started to buzz. A lot. It wasn’t an ordinary text message.
“Dude, silence your phone.” Mello said.
“I already did an hour ago.”
“What?”
Litz checked her phone.
“It’s a national weather alert. ‘High wind watch for Klahanie, November 19 2024.’ Winds are going to start skyrocketing.” Litz said.
Clove stopped walking. “That’s not good.” He signed. “Let’s start moving.”
The 3 walked faster around the place. Sure enough, by the time that the 3 reached Fatburger, the rain started to pour and the wind started to get faster and faster. It reached 75  mph.
“Dude, this is a really bad storm, lets go in fatburger.” Litz said, walking into the entrance.
Mello and Clove followed Litz.
“I don’t really eat fast food very often.” Clove thought.
Mello ordered a milkshake and started drinking it. “I haven’t had food from this place in some time.”
Clove was watching the TV, which was showing some soccer game.
Then some other people came in. One of them was Wave. The other one was another girl, about 1 inch shorter than Wave. Her eyes seemed yellow, but it was hard to tell with the lighting. She doesn’t seem to have wings.
Litz put on her coat and walked to the table farthest from the other 2. “That’s not good.”
Mello and Clove walked to the same table. “It really isn’t.”
“Does she know we’re here? It doesn’t seem like it.” Clove signed.
Wave and the other girl were still talking.
“We can’t tell, it-”
An EAS alert came onto the TV. Clove got visibly startled. “Man I hate how abrupt these alarms are...” Clove signed as he looked at the TV.
The robotic voice that usually plays during EAS alerts started talking. “The National Weather Service has issued a severe wind warning for King County. Take shelter immediately.”
“Scaring my soul just for-”
Another EAS alert came in again. Clove got startled again. Then he looked at the TV again.
“The Sammamish Police Department has issued a Civil Emergency Message for King County. Authorities are searching for fugitives considered dangerous in the area. Residents should remain indoors, lock all doors and windows, and report suspicious activity to 911. The fugitives are the following:” They showed a picture of Clove and Mello. “Clove and Mello. Mello is a teenage boy with purple skin, and Clove is a teenage boy, white, has long blond hair.”
“Ohhh nooo...”
Meanwhile, a couple tables away from them, a girl, about the same age as them, seems to be... happy? They look around. They run to the three.
“Oh my gosh I didn’t expect you guys to be here!!!” She squeals, oddly.
Clove stares at her weirdly.
“...thanks?” Mello said. He noticed her skin is red. Is she also part eel? He doesn’t question it.
“As you can see, I am also part-”
Clove slams the table. Not the rude way. Just a way to tell her to be quiet.
Then he signs to Mello.
“Does she have a crush on you?”
The girl doesn’t know sign language. “I’m sorry, what did he say?”
Mello lies. “He just asked for your name.”
“Oh! Well, I’m Eva.”
Litz just feels off about her. She’s kind, she’s also an eel, she’s not from the government, but also acting kind of odd. Does she have a crush on Mello? What does she need? She doesn’t question it. Even while Eva is staring at Mello weirdly.
She definitely has a crush on me. Mello thinks. “Well... we kind of... don’t like attention... y’know?” Mello sips his milkshake.
“Don’t worry~ I’m keeping it really secret.”
Clove watched her say that as 6 or 7 people behind her were staring at her oddly.
Litz sighed. “Well, we gotta go, you probably know how offensive people are.”
Clove nodded and stood up.
“Yeah... uhm... nice meeting you though...” Mello said, standing up.
The three walked outside. Even while it the wind is going 75 mph. The storm calmed down a little bit.
“Dude, do you know her?” Litz asked.
“No, not at all.”
The three walked away 15.
“...is she following us?” Mello asked.
“Why do you ask that?” Clove signed.
“I can sense the electromagnetic fields from here.” Mello said, not looking back.
Litz sighed. “Let’s find a way to lose sight of her.”
The three split up. Clove headed to the Bellevue mall, Litz walked towards Fred Meyer, and Mello walked in a straight line.
After 5 minutes of walking... Mello could still sense Eva following him. Then she suddenly got faster.
Mello turned around. It indeed was Eva.
“Heyyyyyyyyyy~”
She totally has a crush on me.
“Hey...?”
“I’ve been a fan of you for a long timeeeee!”
“Cool... how long were you an eel?”
“I kind of just became one yesterdayyyy!”
“Ah, cool, uh-”
“Oh, and also, I have something to tell you~”
Mello braced for impact emotionally.
“I’m in lo-”
“That’s... great... but uhh... I-”
“I’m not asking.”
“Huh?”
Eva pulled out her phone. “If you reject me, I will call the cops and say that I have found a ‘fugitive’ in this area.”
Mello could see the no signal sign on her phone. They were too deep into the forest. He smirked faintly. “Call them.”
She pressed the call button. It didn’t go through. She called again. Same thing. She sighed. “I really hate to do this... but... I’m going to bring you to them myself.” She tries to right hook Mello first.
Mello leaned back to avoid the hook. “Eva, calm down, this is part of-”
She aimed for his stomach. Mello dodged the attack again. “I just met you! I don’t even know where-”
Eva tackled Mello with her leg, making Mello land on his back, then started dragging him over the grass. “Too late! I asked and you didn’t accept~”
“You seriously have to-”
She tied his hands together. “No esca-”
Suddenly ghost kitty appeared on Mello’s hands. It scared Eva enough to let go of Mello. It untied his hands.
“Eiiik!”
Mello stands up. “Okay, now you’re-”
Eva recomposes herself. “What, I’m gonna see your dark side now~?” She says jokingly. She goes and tries for a punch, but Mello ducks and kicks her directly in the chin. She stumbles backwards. “Gosh, I-”
Mello dropkicks her. She falls backwards and is unconscious. “I’m sorry.” Mello mumbles. Mello uses the rope to bandage the wounds. Just then, Clove arrived at where Mello is.
“What happened?” Clove signs.
“It turns out, sometimes fans are crazy. She tried to drag me to a van.”
There was a moment of silence. “What do we do now?” Mello asked. 
Clove thought for a moment. Then he grabbed her phone. “We’ll call 911.” He walked towards the road, where there is better signal, and then called 911. 
Mello was about to speak, but Clove silenced him. “They’ll recognize us. Just run. We’re leaving the phone here.” Clove said, putting the phone down and running away with Mello to Fred Meyer.
 
## Chapter 18: Eva 
Eva wakes up in a hospital. It turns out, the 911 operator found her. She wasn’t badly injured, she just had a couple of bruises and an open wound, but needed to go to the hospital. 
 She sat up. Wave walks in.
“Who are you?” Eva asks.
“I’ll tell you later. Remember that kid who knocked you out?”
“Yeah, why?”
“We’re inviting you to join the manhunt for Mello, and 2 others.”
Eva lit up. “Totally!!!”
Wave gives her a form to join. It’s filled with a bunch of legal stuff, like what she’s signing up for, what she can’t do, and what she’s going to get back in return. Eva signs it and gives it to Wave.
Wave takes the form. “Good, just get your clothes and go outside with me.”
After 5 minutes of changing and excitement, Eva enters a car with Wave in it. It soon arrives to the lab.
Meanwhile, the three are walking around to find another shelter while Mello is telling what happened to Litz.
“So, they literally just… attacked you?”
“Yeah, I don’t know why. They-.”
“…hey, kid.”
The three looked to where that voice came from.
It was some man, probably in his 60s, standing next to his van.
“…want some candy?” The man asked nicely.
The three stayed silent.
“…cmon dude I won’t do anything bad. I’m joe, the nicest candy seller around…” The man said, eating his own candy.
“Sorry, but we’re kinda looking for a hangout place…” Litz said.
“…ah. I see…” The man said, looking somewhere. “…oh! I see… you guys are the ones from the blue alert… I’ll still help you… if you go over there, there should be an abandoned cave… hasn’t been touched in a while…” He pointed somewhere.
The three looked over. “Oh, I see it! Thanks!” Mello says.
“…no problem kiddo…” Joe says while tossing the three a candy. Clove catches it and puts it in his pocket.
The three walked towards the cave. It honestly wasn’t that bad, it had a lot of oxygen in it, there was room, and it even had an entrance to the ocean.
“Dang! That’s a nice cave!”
“But how will we bring our stuff back from-“
Ghost kitty teleported all the stuff into the cave. Everybody was shocked.
“…that’s… not a problem anymore.” Clove signed.
“It even brought our lights…” Mello said.
“…and a solar panel for the stuff…” Litz said, staring at the cat.
Ghost kitty meowed.
“That’s good but…”
The three could hear Joe getting questioned.
“Where did they go?”
“…im not telling ya.”
“If you resist we will arrest you.”
“…I don’t care… the kids just needed a shelter yknow..?”
The cop sighed. “Put your hands behind your back. You are under arrest for aiding fugitives.”
Joe relectuantly put their hands behind his back. He got detained, and now he is in the police car.
“Nooo… joe…” Mello said watching this all happen.
Clove stares at the car. It drove away.
Meanwhile, Eva was getting her new gear from Wave.
“So this glove is like a grappling hook?” Eva asked.
“Pretty much.” Wave said. “It also recieves and transmits messages through radio channels.”
“Cool!”
She starts trying the gear out in the testing range. It’s honestly a useful tool.
“So… the next search is going to be in around…” Wave checks the time. “…about 30 minutes. Get a good feel for the grappling hook.” She walks out of the training room.
Meanwhile, back in the cave, everyone was getting to work. They needed to cover up the cave somehow, so they were making an nice entrance to both cover up the cave and easy to walk through. Clove was making the overall base for the entrance, Litz was analyzing the rocks so that they could get it spot on, and Mello was measuring the cave entrance. Ghost kitty was napping the entire time.
After about 45 minutes of working, the entrance was complete. The entrance was what looked like a normal rock wall, it seemed like there was nothing there. However, if you throw a rock at the entrance, it reveals the actual cave.
Clove wipes some sweat off of his forehead. “I think it is finished.”
“Yup.” Mello enters the cave. Everyone else also enters the cave. Now the entrance turned into a normal rock wall again.
A couple of days passed. Mello woke up and looked over to where Litz would sleep. There was a note. Mello picked it up.
I’m at the lab working.
Mello put the note to the side.
Litz, however, wasn’t really working. She hasn’t had anything assigned to her after all of these events, so she was trying to study the species she is. She took a tiny sample from the types of eels (moray, european, american, electric) and tried comparing it to herself.
“So we’re a European eel, huh?” Litz said, as she lays back into her chair. She looks at the electric eel. “What if we could make electromagnetic fields like the electric eel…? We could have an advantage…”
She got to work. Because eels can sense electromagnetic fields with specific organs, she would need to find a way to get organs from electric eels. She was wondering.
“What if I make a pill…? European eels already can sense electricity, what if I amplify that?”
She got to work. She hasn’t created a pill in some time, so she was pretty much warming up. She took some samples, research, and even tried modifying cells from electric eels. Eventually, she made a pill that would send cells to her body to help her sense electricity and people who are carrying something that emits radiowaves (phones, radios, etc.)
“Here goes nothing…” She took the pill. According to herself, the pill would take at least 4 hours to actually fully work, but she would start to feel some effects by 2 hours. “If this works I might share this with Mello…”
Meanwhile, Mello was spinning a fidget spinner. “What do you think Litz is doing?”
Clove was drinking off-brand sprite. “She’s probably just participating in a meeting. I don’t think being in a government lab is as exciting as the movies.”
“True. We’re running out of supplies, I’m going to go get some.” Mello gets a facemask and walks out of the cave.
 
## Chapter 19: Walk Chase
Mello walks around town. Everybody seems to want 3 million dollars, the only thing he hears is people questioning others about his whereabouts. He’s about to walk to Fred Meyer, until…
Someone taps his shoulder. Mello turns around nervously.
“Hey, uh, kid. Have you seen these 2?” She holds up a picture of Mello and Clove.
Mello shakes his head.
She walks away without saying anything. Mello watches her. She goes to talk to her friends.
“Psst. I think that kid in the hood is one of them.” She says.
One of them is about to run to Mello, but she stops them. “Are you crazy? If other people see us chase the kid they will also try to chase the kid! The money is ours.”
The other 3 sigh. “Fine.”
Mello starts to walk away. The 4 follow him. Mello can sense them with electrolocation. He speed walks. They speedwalk.
“It’s definitely him.”
Mello puts on some earbuds (just in case to call Clove) and continues walking while knowing he’s being followed. He keeps a steady pace. If he runs everyone in the town follows him.
I can’t believe I’m being walk chased. How is that even a thing?
After a minute of walking the leader stops. “Split up. We’ll talk with our radios.”
Mello smirks slightly. He can sense radiowaves.
The 4 split up. They still have their radios so Mello still knows where they are. They walk towards an alley.
“I’m preparing for ambush on the alley on the right.”
“Okay, I’ll go to the right of the alley.”
He felt everyone go to the alley. They don’t have their eyes on him anymore. Mello runs to Fred Meyer. The group is now searching the wrong block
“Go go go go go” Mello says while grabbing oranges, apples, things like that.
Then he feels something. Morse code?
.. - .----. ... / .-.. .. - --.. --..-- / .. / -- .- -.. . / .- / .--. .. .-.. .-.. / - --- / -- .- -.- . / . .-.. . -.-. - .-. .. -.-. .. - -.-- / .-.. .. -.- . / . .-.. . -.-. - .-. .. -.-. / . . .-.. ... .-.-.- / -.-. .- -. / -.-- --- ..- / ..-. . . .-.. / .. - ..--.. / .. / -.- -. --- .-- / -.-- --- ..- / -.-. .- -. - / ... . -. -.. / . .-.. . -.-. - .-. .. -.-. / ... .. --. -. .- .-.. ... / .-.. .. -.- . / -- . / ... --- / - . -..- - / -- . / .. ..-. / -.-- --- ..- / -.-. .- -. / ... . -. ... . / - .... .. ... .-.-.-
Mello calls Litz.
Litz picks up. “Did it work?”
“Yes it worked but I kind of need some help right now.” Mello scans the items as fast as possible.
“…huh? With what?”
Mello sensed one of them coming to Fred Meyer. “Just go to Fred Meyer.” He ended the call.
Meanwhile, Litz on the other side was filling out the form for early dismissal. Eva came over.
“Hey!!!” Eva skipped over to Litz while she was frantically filling out the form. “What are you doing? Why are you filling out an early dismissal~?”
Litz finished the form and turned it in. “I have a flight for another place!” She lied as she sprinted out the door with a container with the pills she made in hand. She ran through the forest. “Gosh why do we work in the middle of nowhere…” She pulled out a sharpie and wrote “Donations” on the container so that nobody would suspect anything. She then ran like she was in a marathon for 15 minutes to arrive at Fred Meyer. 
Then she saw Mello sprinting out of there being chased by someone. She sprinted in front of them. “Wait- uh- would you like to donate to children in Africa?”
“No.” They were about to go around her but Litz blocked them.
“Are you- are you sure? There are millions of kids and families in need of food!” Litz said, trying to act desperate. Even though this was a way to distract them, she would still donate whatever she got from them if any.
She picked up a random rusty penny on the ground. “Take this. Now get out of my way.” 
Litz was a little disappointed, she didn’t really stall for that long but she still had to move out of the way. “Have a nice day.”
The person ran after Mello again. Mello gained enough distance to get out of sight from the 4 people, thanks to Litz. He was about ¾ of a mile away from all of them. “Should be enough for me to return to the cave…” He ran to the cave again, where Clove was staring at the camera feeds incredulously.
Meanwhile, Litz was walking back to the lab. Then the 4 people got about 3 meters away from her.
“Hey!” The leader said.
Litz turned around.
“You made us lose our chance to get 3 MILLION dollars!”
Litz thought for a moment. “Was it worth it? Trying to capture a teen thats 4 years younger than you? You would do that for 3 million dollars?”
There was a moment of silence with the wind.
“…it’s not about the money.” The leader lied without remorse.
“You didn’t answer my question.”
Then the leader got a little agitated. “You think we care about fish? We EAT fish. That’s how it’s ALWAYS been since the cavemen ages.”
“It has been like that since the Paleolithic ages. But think about it. Do you think the kid was born an eel and then became human? Or do you think he was born a human and turned into an eel?”
Litz waited for her response.
There was silence.
 “It doesn’t matter.”
Then there was a snap from a branch from behind them. They looked at it, while Litz took a step back, then 2, then started running.
“HEY!” The other 4 started to chase after her.
Litz was still sprinting away. Then Ghost Kitty appeared beside her. She got startled for a moment.
“What is it…?”
Ghost Kitty made sounds (that sounded like footsteps), started to go the other way, and led the other 4 away from her.
Litz was sprinting. “Sometimes it scares me and other times it helps me.”
 
## Chapter 20: A long swim
Litz came back into the cave after about 5 hours. Mello was planning something, Clove was making something, and Ghost Kitty was sleeping.
“What’re you doing?” Litz asked while taking off her lab coat.
“Plan.” Clove signed.
“There’s a lab a couple of miles from yours. Could have some info.” Mello said.
Litz went over to the map. “Oh, that one. It’s really far though. All the way in Lynden.”
“That’s why we’re planning to swim.” Clove said.
“It’s 100 miles…?” Litz said.
“We could stay on islands.” Mello said.
Litz thought for a moment. Maybe there could be a chance. “I’ll send an email.” Litz went over to her laptop and started typing up a fake excuse on how she’s going to a concert.
3 hours later… 10 PM…
The 3 (or four, including Ghost Kitty) were at the shoreline in Richmond beach. It was odd. Not much people. Not much people go to the beach at night. Mello was in his hoodie and backpack with supplies, Litz was in a shirt, and Clove was in a diving suit he made. Clove checked a map. “The currents should be at peak state to help us. I think we should start moving.”
Mello sighed. “Well, now or never.”
Litz checked her map from her phone. “The first stop is Whidbey island. I’m not sure if I pronounced that correctly, but it’s about 17 miles away from here.”
Ghost Kitty meowed.
“I guess no time to waste.” Clove signed, stepping into the water.
Litz and Mello followed him.
They got deep enough. Clove started swimming. Mello and Litz could swim faster than Clove, but they just decided to stay with him.
1.5 hours pass…
Mello’s looking at the sand beneath him. There isn’t much to see.
“Lookin down at something?” Litz asked.
“Not much. I don’t think it really counts as something.” Mello said.
“It’s either something or nothing.”
“It’s probably nothing.”
1.5 more hours pass…
Litz is the first to arrive at Whidbey island, followed by Mello and Clove coming in about 5 seconds later. “Welcome to Whidbey island.” Litz says, lying down onto the sand, looking up.
Mello checks the time. “It’s 1 AM.”
Clove dries off his suit and looks at the map again. “Next stop should be Camano island. For now, we should get some rest.”
They walked under a bridge and slept there.
10 hours later…
The three were on the shoreline of Whidbey island.
“Well, Camano island isn’t that far.” Clove said.
“Patrol guards will become more active, we should start moving.” Litz said.
The three entered the water.
1 hour later…
They arrive at Camano island. Mello is the first to get on the island. “That wasn’t very long.”
Litz gets out of the water 15 seconds after Mello. “Welcome to Camano… I think.”
Clove gets out. “You think?”
“Camano has a lot of names.”
Mello checks his map. “The next stop is Shaw island.”
“Let’s get some breakfast first.” Litz says.
They get onto Camano sidewalk. They walk around for a while. They eventually stop at a café and eat an omelete. Ghost Kitty eats from a bowl of some cereal.
“Shaw island is kind of far.” Clove signs.
“Yeah, I planned to sneak onto a patrol boat to take the ride there.” Litz responds.
“Fair.” Mello said.
2 hours later… 2 PM…
The 3 are swimming again.
“Be prepared. We might not see another patrol boat for some time.” Clove signs.
An hour passes…
They see a boat. It’s bigger and faster than them, and it’s heading in the same direction.
“Should we go on it?” Litz asks.
“If we swim normally it would take 8 hours, lets get on it.”
Mello grabbed onto the anchor chain from the ship and started climbing with Clove and Litz. They get on it.
“This doesn’t seem like a patrol boat…” Litz says.
Clove looked around it. “A modern pirate boat…?”
“So we’re on a modern pirate boat…” Mello says.
“Let’s hide in the storage.”
They sneak to the storage, avoiding about 20 people around the boat. When they get to the storage there’s a lot of fish tanks with all sorts of fish.
“Are they illegally fishing? How do they have so much axolotls?” Litz asks.
“Out of all the types of-“
They heard footsteps.
“Oh my god, where do we go?” Litz asked, looking around.
Clove looked up. “Ceiling.” He climbed onto the ceiling frames.
Litz climbed onto there. There wasn’t enough room for Mello.
“Screw it man.” He hid in the fridge with Ghost Kitty.
The pirate walked into the storage room. “Can’t believe we’re going to sell this guy now-“
Then Wave crashed through the window, somehow silently. “STOP RIGHT THERE!”
“What the hell is Wave doing here?” Litz asked.
Then Eva slid through the window with her wingsuit.
“Eva joined wave?” Clove signs.
Mello couldn’t see what was going on (he was in the fridge) but he could still tell someone else entered. “What in the world is happening out there…?”
The pirate backed towards the door. “What are you doing here? Who even are you two?”
“We’re federal agents, and YOU are illegally selling fish!” Eva said, sounding more excited than serious.
Clove watched from above. “The other door is opening…”
“That’s bad… I’m not looking” Litz said, looking away like she’s watching a horror movie.
The pirate smirked. “Well, there’s another crime we’re about to commit.”
Then the 2 got knocked out by another pirate behind them.
Clove was shocked. “Oh hell no.”
Then they took them out of the room. Clove hopped onto the ground and tapped on the fridge.
Mello gets out of the fridge. “Dude, what was going on out there?”
Litz hopped down, clearly shaken. “There was- there was Wave and Eva- and- and then they confronted him- and then- and then- and then they got kidnapped!” She was pacing back and forth the room.
Clove thought for a moment. He was surprisingly calm for something like this. “Maybe-”
Then everything went black for everyone.
 
## Chapter 21: The great escape
Clove was the first to wake up. His head hurt, but not too much. It reminds him of something. He doesn’t want to think about it. He looks around. Wooden floor, and metal bars. He’s the only one in the cell. He stands up, looks to the other cell.  Outside of his cell is a table, and it had what they were carrying. To the right of Clove, in another cell, is Eva and Wave, unconcious.
That’s not good. Where’d Mello and Litz go?
Clove tests the metal bars. They’re bolted to the ground. He tests the wood on the ground. They’re old, but sturdy. He looked at what he had. Not much. Just 7 medium sized pebbles. He goes to a plank with a tiny hole in it, and drops a pebble in it. He listens. It’s not that far of a drop, and it leads to another section in the ship.
Clove thinks. Ghost Kitty isn’t with him, neither is Mello or Litz. He’s escaped something like this before 3 times, he could surely do it a 4th time. He decides to stomp on the boards to break them. One of them breaks. He slips through the plank.
Now Clove is in another storage room, not with fish, but with weapons. Clove doesn’t want to hurt anyone. He grabs a pocketknife for safety. He sees a ladder leading down to somewhere. It’s dark down there, so he ignores it. He opens a door slightly.
Nobody’s there.
He sneaks through. There are two doors now.
This thing is a maze, man.
He peeks through one door. There were pirates. He looks through the other. There were also pirates. They were gathered around something though. Could it be Mello? He opens the door slightly, enters, and hides behind a couple of boxes. He listens. He can’t hear it very well but can hear some info.
”Hah, we’re going to sell you now!”
“I’m so glad we can finally sell this kid.
“I know, she kept cleaning everything wrong. Hahahaha!”
Then the captain walks in. “Everybody! It’s time for our meeting!”
“Sorry, sorry, let’s go now guys!”
Clove waits for them to leave. Then he peeks over the box.
There’s a girl there. She wasn’t human. She seemed to also be part fish, but she wasn’t an eel. She was tied up to a beam.
Clove gets out of his hiding spot. He walks behind the girl. She didn’t say anything. He unties her, but he didn’t realize she was unconscious, so she almost fell over. Clove grabs her arm. Her skin (or scales) and clothes are really dirty and ragged, was she a prisoner for a long time?
Now I have to deal with this too…
She starts to slowly wake up. Clove brings her upright. She slowly looks around; she seems really tired. Then she notices Clove and gets startled slightly. She takes a couple steps back.
“Wh- Who are you?”
Clove signs his name. She doesn’t know ASL.
“I don’t… understand.”
Clove points at the now untied rope.
“Your name is rope?”
Clove shakes his head. He shows the pocketknife he had in his hand.
“So… you’re the person who untied me…?”
Clove nods.
“Th-Thanks.”
Clove notices how off she is. 
She isn’t acting normal. Is she depressed? I’m not going to question it.
“What are you?” Clove signs.
“I still don’t understand.”
Clove points at a fish nearby, then points at her.
“Oh. Well… I’m- uhh- I’m a koi fish…?”
That’s why she has orange and white spots…
Clove nods. Then he points at her, trying to ask for her name.
She takes a couple of seconds to realize it.
“Oh, uhm- I’m- I’m Reqn.”
That’s a nice name.
Clove takes a step towards her. She takes a step back.
Yeah, I think she’s depressed. PTSD?
Clove takes a step back. Then he looks around. He wants to ask her if she’s seen Mello and Litz, but he can’t use ASL. He sighs. He grabs a random map of Washington and a marker. He circles where the cave is, writes down what it is, and gives a compass and the map to Reqn.
“You want me to… go there?”
Clove writes something down. “It has necessary supplies. Me and my friends will come back there in about a day or two.”
Reqn nods. “Th-Thanks.” She walks away.
Pray that she makes it.
 
## Chapter 22: Bottom Deck.
Mello wakes up. He’s wet, and upside down. “…ick.” He looks down, he’s in chains. In fact, he was in chains entirely, the only thing that is not in chains is his tail. “Wow. Best place to be in…” Mello looks around. Nobody else is with him. His only source of light is a dim light bulb on the ceiling and a tiny window. “Man I might be cooked…”
He tries swinging back and forth with the chain. There isn’t much he can do when he’s chained up. He gains a little momentum.
“Okay… if I have this momentum, I should be able to grab the light bulb with my tail, and-“
Then one of the chains snapped. Mello fell onto the ground. “…that’s another way.” Mello is still in chains, he can’t stand up. Then a pirate walks in.
“Something break? Probably the gravity. Well, back in chains you go.”
The pirate chains him (yes, even more) to a beam. Now he can barely move, aside from breathing.
“We going to make good money with you.” The pirate says as he walks away from the room.
Mello looks down to the ground. There isn’t really much to do. He has a whole lot of chains on him and-
Meow…
Mello looked up. Ghost Kitty! It unlocks the padlock, and the chains fell. Mello stepped out.
“Man, you’re the nicest kitty I have seen.” Mello says, stretching. He walks out of the door. There’s a ladder going up. Mello climbs up.
He’s in the same storage room Clove was in. He looks around. Tons of weapons. He doesn’t want to hurt anyone, but he still grabs the pistol. Maybe there’s a lock he can shoot open with the gun. He tries opening a door, but it’s locked. He opens another door slightly and peeks outside. Nobody is outside. He steps outside.
His hand is shaking with the gun. “If I could find Litz and Clove…” Another room beside him has pirates in it. He peeks through the door.
There’s Reqn. Mello doesn’t recognize her (he didn’t see her when Clove met her). She’s been caught by a pirate. The pirate is about to knock her out.
“Ohhhh man…” Mello kicks open the door, even when he has a bad feeling about this. He aims the gun shakily at the pirate. “Put your hands up… or something!” He’s not going to shoot, but he wants to make sure the pirate lets go of Reqn.
“Kid, put that gun down. You don’t even know if it’s loaded!” The pirate said, still holding onto Reqn.
Mello pointed at a can nearby and shot it (and missed the can by a long shot). “Now… now I know it is!” It had a suppressor; so it didn’t make much noise.
The pirate scoffs. “You missed that by at least 3 meters. Kid, just listen and put the gun down.” His grip on Reqn tightens. “You can’t fire that at a real person.”
Mello could hear footsteps behind him. The gunshot alerted another pirate. They were coming up fast. He sighed, and dropped the gun. Then he bolted at the pirate. He tried to dropkick him. He simply sidestepped. Mello dropkicks the window and flies out of the ship.
“OHHHH FRIIII…”
Clove watched Mello fly out of the ship and into the water from the top deck.
What the hell did Mello do now?
Clove dropped the anchor to lower the chain. Mello should be able to climb out now. Then he ran to the bottom deck, to where Mello was. He grabbed a wrench and burst through the door. He threw the wrench at an insanely perfect angle and hit the 2 pirates in the head. Reqn was safe. She walked towards Clove.
“How-how did you do that?”
Clove pointed at his brain.
“C-cool.”
He led her up to the top deck; where the anchor chain is.
Clove writes on a piece of paper. “I recommend you leave now.”
Reqn nods. “Thank you.” She climbs down the anchor chain.
Clove walks away.
Reqn swims for a while. Then Mello and Reqn cross paths.
“Ah. Uh… hello?” Mello says awkwardly. It’s a little odd seeing someone after he got yeeted out of the ship.
“…hi.” Reqn says weirdly.
They swim away.
 
## Chapter 23: A weird place.
Litz wakes up in a janitor’s closet. It’s cramped.
“Ick.”
She stands up (barely, due to the cramped space). She tries to open the door; it’s locked.
“Great.”
She looks around the closet. She finds a crowbar and grabs it. She tries prying the door open, and it works. She gets out of the closet.
Now she’s in the same closet that everyone else was in. She looks around. Then she hears something break from beneath her. She looks down. A plank broke. She got out of the way. Then she heard Eva and Wave from beneath her.
“You think we’re going to take out all of the pirates?” Eva said excitedly.
“No. We’re returning to base and reporting what we found.” Wave started climbing up to the floor. 
Litz quietly ran away. “The others are probably here somewhere…” She moved around. Eventually, she entered the prison room; where Clove was. The table with their stuff was still there. Litz took Mello’s backpack and put it on. Then she continued walking around. She got on top deck, and found Mello.
“Why are you wet?” Litz asked.
“Long story.” Mello said.
Litz handed Mello his bag. “Where’s Clove?”
Mello put on his bag. “Last time I saw he-“
Then they heard a helicopter. They both looked up. The helicopter was landing on the ship. The helicopter belonged to the pirates.
“That’s not good.” Litz said.
“No kidding.”
They both ran back to the lower decks, then found Clove.
Clove looked back at them. “What is that noise outside?”
“It’s a helicopter.” Litz said.
Clove smirked. “Let’s go to the helicopter.”
“Wait, what?”
The three ran to the top deck.
“There’s still people there. Let’s sneak.”
They went hiding behind stuff. Meanwhile, 4 pirates were still near the helicopter.
“Yeah yeah, we’ll be able to make the transport.”
They sneaked onto the helicopter.
“You know how to pilot this-“
Clove was reading a book on how to fly the helicopter.
“…we are doomed.” Mello said, facepalming.
Clove put on a headset, tossed the others a headset, and started up the helicopter.
“What the-“ The pirates looked at the helicopter.
“DUDE DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW TO PILOT THIS THING???” Litz asked frantically.
Clove shrugged. He took another look at the book and flicked a switch to his right.
The helicopter started to take off. Slowly.
Mello pointed outside the helicopter. “THEY HAVE RIFLES!”
One of the bullets barely missed the propeller.
Clove started to fly away from the pirate ship and hit their flag in the process. Clove piloted the helicopter for 15 minutes.
 
## Chapter 24: A lab in Lynden
Then Mello spoke up. “Uh, how are we going to sneak in there?”
Litz wondered for a moment. “I should’ve thought of that.”
Clove signed with one hand. “Make a fake authorized landing.”
“Okay, but how will we enter? We can fake a landing outside the lab but then only Litz has access to the lab.”
Litz looked around the helicopter. She looked at a container. “You could both try going in there.”
Mello sighed. “Better than nothing.”
Some time passes of them getting ready. Litz was now piloting the helicopter and the other 2 were in a container.
Litz tunes the radio to the lab. “Hello? Do you read me?”
It takes some time for someone else to respond. “Who is this?”
“I’m Litz Reliser, I come from the Seattle lab.”
The other side types for a moment. “What is your id number?”
Litz pulls out her id. “It’s 12494102048.”
 They type again. “Do you have authorization from Will, the supervisor of the Seattle lab?”
“Yes.”
“Please send proof.”
Clove types on his laptop while he’s in the container. He hits send and bangs on the container a little to signal Litz.
“I just sent it.”
They read the email. “What is your purpose to land?”
“I have some mixtures that could be used for capturing Mello and Clove.” She rolled her eyes at the last part sarcastically.
They type again. “You are authorized to land. Please land at C38.”
“Thank you.”
Litz preforms a shaky landing at C38. Guards arrive at the helicopter.
“You must be Litz, right?”
Litz takes off her headset. “Yes.”
The other guards approach the container. “We’ll need to do a manual inspection of the mixtures.”
Mello panicks quietly inside the container “Crap! What do we do?”
Clove thinks. He looks around what he has. “Make a fake bottom.” Clove signs.
The guards open the container. Doesn’t look suspicious. “Seems clear. We’ll leave this in storage so you can pick it up later.”
Litz nods. “Where do I enter?”
The guards take the container to storage.
“Follow me.” The other guard says to Litz. He turns around and walks to the building.
Meanwhile, the guards put down the container in storage. “Man is it just me or am I not fit anymore?”
“I dunno man.” They walk away.
Mello peeks outside. Nothing there. He opens the container and gets out.
“How are you not cramped?” Clove signs, stretching.
“Maybe it’s because I’m an eel?”
Clove steps out of the container. He looks around. He hears footsteps. “Patrol guards.”
They close the container and hide behind a couple of shelves.
The guards walks up to the container. He inspects it. “Probably just me.” He walks away.
Mello and Clove get out of the shelf and sneak around.
“Put anything we find into the container.” Mello whispered.
Clove nodded.
About 15 minutes pass. The container got partially filled with some files.
“We should be kind of good now.” Clove signed.
He pulls out a small device from his pocket.
“What’s that?” Mello asks.
“Something. It’s not a bomb, don’t wor-“
Then an explosion was heard.
“…you sure that’s not a bomb?”
“I don’t think it is.” Clove signed.
The two tried to get outside of the storage room, but it was locked. Clove put whatever he had on the keypad.
“How long will that take?”
The thing beeped. Clove opened the door; it was now unlocked.
Mello grabbed the container and ran out the door.
“What is going on outside???”
Clove looked outside. “It’s the pirates! They’re in their own helicopters!”
Mello shoved the container inside the helicopter.
Clove hid inside the container with Mello.
Meanwhile, Litz was running out to the helicopter. The guards were shooting at the pirate helicopters while Litz got the helicopter ready.
“30 seconds left…” Litz put on her headset and tossed the container some headsets. Clove caught them.
Litz checked the manual. The she grabbed the handle and started a not-very-good liftoff. “Sorry for that!”
Mello got out of the container. He looked behind the helicopter. “They’re chasing us!”
Clove also got out. He grabbed a parachute just in case. He got his TTS translator. “It will take about 30 minutes to get back to Seattle. We do not have enough fuel. With this fuel, we would only get about 2/3 of the way.”
“We should-“
The pirates shot the coolant. The helicopter’s temperature started to rise.
“We have no choice!” Mello said. “We have to ditch the helicopter!” He grabbed a parachute.
Litz grabs a parachute too.
“We have to bring the container with us.” Clove said.
“Okay, seal the container!” Mello closes the container tightly.
“Okay, we jump on three… 1… 2… 3!” Litz jumped out.
Mello pushed the container off and rode it like a sled.
Clove jumped out last.
The pirates in the helicopter were confused. “…well, that’s that.”
The 3 landed in the ocean safely. Clove cut off their parachutes.
Mello coughed. “I’m surprisingly ok.”
“We should swim back to the cave.” Litz said.
 
## Chapter 25: Cave.
After about 1.5 days of swimming, resting, and hiding, they finally made it back to the cave. It was nighttime.
“Remind me to take a plane next time.” Mello said, drenched.
Ghost kitty meowed.
“That was the longest swimming times I-“ Litz noticed Reqn. “Oh, hello.”
Clove dived towards the mattress sloppily. “Yeah, that’s the girl from the pirate ship.” He signed.
“Hi.” Mello said.
“Hi…” Reqn said.
Ghost Kitty meowed.
Reqn was reading an ASL dictionary in blankets.
Clove was already sleeping.
Mello couldn’t really sleep (eels are nocturnal).
Litz couldn’t sleep either.
Ghost kitty slept near Reqn.
Mello was watching Back to the Future with a projector camera.
“That movie is as old as time.” Litz said.
“It’s surprisingly good for an old movie.” Mello said.
“What’s a movie?” Reqn asked.
Mello was a little surprised but he still answered. “It’s like a story but told in pictures.”
“Look, this one is talking about how a kid traveled back in time with a car somehow.” Litz said.
“Some of them are real, some of them aren’t.” Mello said.
“Where do you get a ‘movie’?” Reqn asked, putting a bookmark in her dictionary.
“You can find them at stores.” Litz said.
Reqn stood up. “Can we go to a store?”
“Sure. I don’t have much to do anyway.” Mello said, pausing the movie and standing up. “Go put on a coat, it’s kind of cold outside today.”
15 minutes later…
Litz, Mello, and Reqn were walking to Target.
“Are you sure this is Gilman road? I don’t see any mans with gills.” Reqn asked.
“That’s just what the place is called. There’s no mans with gills here. Except us, I guess.” Mello shrugged.
“Yup. Just don’t attract too much attention.” Litz said.
They enter target.
“There’s not much people here today…” Litz said.
“Well, over here theres the CDs we can watch.” Mello said. “So, just pick one, I guess.”
Reqn looked around. “This one looks nice.” She pointed at Friday the 13th.
“Uhhh, no.” Litz said.
“Why?”
“Very scary. Besides, we need someone over 18 to buy that for us.” Mello said.
“How do I know if it’s over 18?”
Mello pointed at the age rating in the lower left of the case. “If that says R or NC-17, we can’t buy it. In this case, that is R, so we can’t buy that.”
“Why are we not allowed to buy R or NC-17?” Reqn asked.
Mello looks for 3 other CDs. “Look, every movie has some sort of age rating.” Mello put the discs in order of age rating. He pointed at the Peppa Pig movie. “G means anyone can watch it,” He points at the Minecraft movie. “PG means kids like 7 or 8 can watch it,” He points at Rush Hour. “PG-13 means teens can watch it,” He points at Friday the 13th “R means only adults can watch it, and NC-17 basically means to throw the disc out of your house before your kids see it.” Mello put the discs back. “Most stores don’t sell NC-17, including this one.”
Reqn wondered for a little. “So no R…” She looks around. “What about that one?” She points at Up.
“Sure. That’s a nice one.” Litz picks that off of the shelf and goes to checkout.
Mello buys some Takis and pays for it.
Eventually they’re walking out of Target.
Mello is eating Takis. “So… yeah. That’s buying CD’s from a store.”
Litz eats a Taki. “Yup. Then there’s-“
They see a white van. Joe’s van?
“Hm?” Reqn looks at the van. “What’s that?”
Mello is confused. Why is Joe’s van there? He got arrested! “Uh… the van… it belongs to someone who told us about the cave. He got arrested… but… how is the van here?”
Someone in a hoodie walks out. It looks like Joe. He’s holding a bag of candy. “Kid… want some candy?”
“I don’t think that’s a good sign… you sure it’s him?” Reqn asks.
“We don’t know…” Litz says.
“Don’t worry kid… I won’t bite… I’m Shady Joe… the candy man!”
Mello gets a weird feeling. “Eat your candy first. Then I will see it.”
Shady Joe eats his candy. “See? Nothing wrong...”
“No no no… that came from your pocket. Take one from your bag.”
“Sorry kid… I have high blood pressure…” Shady Joe says.
Reqn is getting a little scared. “Can we go now…?” She gets closer to Litz.
Mello speaks up. “Hey… uhh, sorry, it’s pretty late… we should go now…”
“…want a ride?”
“No thanks, we’re good on our own…” Litz said.
Shady Joe sighs. “Well, bye.” Shady Joe gets in his van.
Mello and the others walk away. “Huh. Do you think that was-“
“LOOK OUT!” Litz grabs Reqn and dives to the left.
“Huh-“ Mello looks back. Shady Joe was about to hit them with their van! “WOAH” Mello dives away.
Shady Joe’s tires barely touched Mello’s shoes.
Litz stands up. “What the hell is your problem?!?”
Shady Joe’s van stops. Then he gets out. “Listen kids,” He has something behind him. “Let’s just forget this entire thing-“
“HE’S ARMED!” Mello says.
Reqn dives towards Shady Joe behind him. She sucessfully disarmed him and threw the gun far, but Shady Joe gets her off of him. He throws her onto the ground, about 5 feet away from him. Reqn is unconsious now.
Joe is agitated now. He grabs a gun and points it at Mello, menacingly. “Put. Your hands. Up.”
Mello put his hands up. Litz also did.
The gun fired. Not from Shady Joe. Someone else. It didn’t hit anyone. Shady Joe looked behind him.
It was Joe! “Next time I won’t miss.”
Shady Joe wasn’t the kind to give a speech on anything. He fired. Twice. To Joe.
Joe died.
Police were arriving. Shady Joe tried to shoot Mello, but he didn’t have any ammo left. He got in his van and drove away.
Litz fainted.
Mello cried. He hides the 2 behind a tree. He can hear them breathing. That’s good. He reaches to his pocket shakily and texts Clove. His hands shake while typing.
*Joe did.*
It took a while for Clove to respond.
*Joe did what?*
*Joe died. He dird.*
Clove goes offline for some time.
The sirens eventually go away. The police are still there, marking the scene.
Clove texted again.
*Where.
Trget parking lot
Are they still there
The amblacne is gone bt the police ar stil ther.
Hwo ar the others?
Litz fainted and Reqn is unconsious. They are still aliv.
Why?
Shady Joe.
Don’t joke around.
I’m not joking. His name is Shady Joe. He killed Joe, his twin.
Shady Joe shot Reqn?
No, he fighted Reqn, and Litz fainted due to shck.
Stay there. I bring med suplies.
k.*
Mello leaned towards the tree. He peeked behind the tree. Joe was gone, and the cops are putting caution tape around the scene. Other police were talking to witnesses.
Meanwhile, Clove prepared one of his drones. He’s been making this drone for some time, he can finally use it. He put the drone over his head, got outside, grabbed the handle, and started flying.
Clove arrived with the medkit.
Mello sighed. “The police left.” He said, standing up.
“They’ll probably be coming back soon. Let’s hurry.” Clove shined a flashlight onto Reqn’s head. “Minor bleeding.” He pulled out some bandages and patched up where Reqn was bleeding.
Mello checked Litz. “Doesn’t seem to have any injuries.”
They both helped Litz and Reqn get back to the cave.
 
## Chapter 26: Work.
A couple of weeks pass. Mello has gotten over Joe’s death, Litz is still working, Clove is making stuff, and Reqn learned some ASL.
Clove was making stuff, Reqn watched Clove, and Mello was playing chess with Litz.
“That’s illegal.” Mello says.
Litz looks at the board again. “No it’s not.”
“It is. You checkmated me, and that’s illegal according to my king’s laws.”
“Where’s your king’s laws?”
“…it’s in my head.”
Litz rolls her eyes. “Well, that king is no longer a king anymore.”
Ghost Kitty taps Mello’s king. Then it just brings it to it’s own corner.
“Look, the king went to jail because his laws were so bad.” Litz says.
“He’s… uhh… he’s been framed! That’s why he went to jail.”
Reqn stares at Clove welding something. “How do you not run out of propane when using that blowtorch?”
Clove shrugs. He takes off his mask, grabs a hammer from his shelf and starts banging on the metal to get it into shape.
“What’re you making anyway?” Reqn asks.
“Something to get supplies easier.” Clove signs with his free hand.
Mello is thinking of something. “Okay, well, my king says that pawns can promote to a king.” He moves his pawn to the edge of the board.
Litz looks at the board. “If your pawn promotes to a king you get checkmated a second time.”
Mello blinks. “My pawn becomes a lawyer and he makes the judge pardon the king. Now the king is not in jail, and it’s not checkmate.”
Litz thinks. “An earthquake happens and the king dies before he was pardoned. Now it’s checkmate.”
“Nuh uh, his kid just became an adult and now he is king.”
“You guys are turning this into a dungeons and dragons game.” Reqn says.
“Good idea.” Litz grabs a dice. “If it lands 4 or higher the king gets robbed and doesn’t have the resources to manage his land.” She rolls the dice.
It lands 5.
“He loses his money and food.” Litz says. “Now it’s checkmate.”
“Nuh uh.” Mello bangs on the table and makes the dice roll again.
It lands 6.
“Now the king loses his home to a dragon.” Clove signs jokingly.
Ghost Kitty knocks all of Mello’s pieces over.
“That’s a sad life for the king’s kid.” Reqn said.
“Darn.” Mello picked up the pieces and put them aside. He stood up and went over to the fridge.
That night, Mello and Litz somehow slept like normal people. But Clove didn’t really sleep. Reqn either.
Clove was still working on stuff.
Reqn was watching again, but not as attentive this time.
Clove noticed. “Something wrong?” He signed with his free hand, the other hand inspecting something.
Reqn sighed. “…no. Kind of.”
Clove raised an eyebrow, even though he knew she couldn’t see it with his welding mask on. “It’s either yes or no.”
Reqn sighs. “Y’know, when I used to be on that ship, I kinda had to do a lot of stuff. Clean, make beds, and sometimes driving the ship at night. Then I would barely get fed… and I would sleep on the same pole you found me in.” Reqn slumped back. “Y’know, I feel as if some other fish is gonna be in that same position again…”
Clove felt kind of bad.
“Before all of that, I used to be a fish swimming in the ocean. Then someone died. In that time, something happened. Now… I’m her-“
Clove was so shocked he almost burned himself with the blowtorch. He stopped the blowtorch.
“Hold it. I don’t mean to be evil and stop your backstory, but you were a fish. Correct?”
“Y-yeah.”
Clove thought for a moment. “Did an eel possess Mello’s body…?”
“It works like this. Whatever fish is swimming nearby when the body drowns takes over the body. Their memories and thoughts are combined.”
Clove took off the welding mask and sat down, processing the information.
“Don’t mind me asking, but why do you always have hair covering your right eye…?”
Clove thought for a moment.
If she can tell me something, I could probably tell her something…
He lifted the hair. His eye underneath the hair was bandaged.
“W-what happened?” Reqn asked.
“Problems. I used to live with my aunt, and when my aunt tried to attack someone with a bat, I called 911. She hit me with the bat before I could talk with 911. That’s why I’m mute in the first place, and why my aunt is in jail now.” Clove’s hair fell down again. “Even if I do see with that eye again, it’s damaged so much it’s colorblind now. The eye I see with doesn’t.”
“I’m sorry.”
Clove thought for a moment. “I gotta check those files again.” Clove walked over to the container with files inside of it.
“What’re you looking for?”
“Anything that can explain why Mello is purple and why Litz is green. Even more, if Litz took Mello’s DNA and accidentally ingested it, did the eel also take over her body???” Clove opened the container.
About an hour passes of Clove reading the files, Reqn finding relevant files, and Ghost Kitty still playing around with the king from chess.
“I don’t think there’s anything.” Clove says.
“Yup. Me neither.”
They cleaned up and went to bed.
Another day passes. Litz went to work.
Litz walks around in the hallways for some time. She’s still waiting for something to do.
Then Wave walks up to her. “What are you doing…?”
“I’m waiting for something.”
“Waiting for what?”
“An assignment to do.”
Wave thinks.
Then the supervisor, Will, comes up. “Litz.”
“Yeah?”
“You have something.”
“Oh. Nice.”
Will hands her a folder. “Read this. It contains what you need to do.” He walks away.
Litz opens the folder. “…but it’s all redacted…?”
Wave looks into the folder. “Weird.”
“Except for the fact that if I don’t complete it I get fired.” Litz reads. “I’m cooked.”
“How’re you supposed to finish that? You don’t even know the name of the assignment!”
Litz goes to her lab. “I should find a way to unredact this stuff…”
Meanwhile, Mello and Reqn was working at McDonalds.
“Why does my cheesburger have cheese in it?” The person in the drive through asks.
“It’s a cheeseburger.” Mello says.
“But cheeseburgers shouldn’t have cheese in it!”
“Then don’t order a cheeseburger. Order a hamburger. Besides, who likes their burger without cheese?”
“Listen up kid, I will make sure to ruin your career if you don’t take my cheese off my cheese burger. Do you understand?”
“Good luck with that.” He closes the window.
Reqn is also at the drive through. “Hi what would you like?”
“Can I get a quarter pounder with no mustard?”
Reqn feels like the person ahead is slightly familiar. She can’t see the person though. “Sure. What drink?”
“Dr. Pepper.”
Reqn taps on the keyboard. “That’ll be 10 at the window.”
They drive to the window.
“Cash or-“ Mello realizes who it is.
Shady Joe is glaring at him.
They can’t do anything; they’re in a public space.
“…card. Cash or card.”
“…cash.” Shady Joe says, handing over 10 dollars.
Mello takes it. He prepares the meal. He gives it to Shady Joe.
Shady Joe takes it. He drives off without saying anything.
Mello memorizes the license plate. He pulls out his phone.
Clove. Can you track a car?
Yes. Why?
SFJ2930. That’s Shady Joe’s license plate.
I’ll try. It will take at least 15 minutes.
That’s okay.
They both go offline.
Clove is currently working at a facility. He’s helping a group build a bridge. He walks up to the boss.
“I need to go.” Clove says with his TTS.
“You can’t.” The boss says.
“Why.”
“You need to work an hour more.”
“It’s serious.”
“If you go you’ll get an hour docked of salary.”
“If I don’t go I quit.”
“Deal.”
“Give me the money I earned first.”
“No.”
“It’s in the contract.”
The boss sighs. He hands over 20.
“Thank you.” Clove goes on his bike and starts riding it to the cave.
Meanwhile, Litz is still trying to unredact the file.
“I could try and find this file online…” She goes on her computer. She scans the barcode near the back of the file.
The computer beeps. It loads the file. But it’s still redacted.
“You really want me to leave this lab, huh Will.” She tries a lot of things. After 15 minutes of going online finding an unredaction tool, she copies and pastes the file. Everything was unredacted now.
“Oh. Simple as that.” She reads the file. Then she immediately puts her head down on her desk. “Is Will seriously asking me to make something to help make hybrids? I don’t think I’m keeping this job.”
She reads the files a little bit more. It’s mostly about what in specific she has to build.
Litz wipes her glasses. “At this rate, I better go to Will and ask to assign something else to me.”
She stands up and out of her lab. She knocks onto Will’s office.
“Come in.” Will says, reading some reports.
Litz opens the door. “Sir, I believe this task may not be for me.”
“And why is that?”
“I’m not an engineer or doctor. I don’t study bodies and making machines.”
Will sets the reports aside. “Think about what we could do. We could help others with search and rescue missions.”
“It says here that you’re going to use this for ‘combat assistance.’ I’m not going to help with that, nor can I even help with that. Ask Lisa or something.”
“Lisa is occupied.”
“Doesn’t look like it.”
Will sighs. “Listen, we have to do this. The other people that are already like this are violent. Like that other new one, I think her name was Reqn-“
“But you don’t know what she’s been through! On top of that, she’s not even violent! The only violent thing she’s done is run away!”
“Listen, they are not people anymore. They are a public safety concern and Mello proved that.”
“Listen, if I will be involved in whatever you call ‘safety assistance’ I won’t be participating in this.”
“This assignment is mandatory. No exceptions.”
“Yeah, I quit.” Litz threw her badge into the trash. She handed back the folder. “What you are doing is-“
Then guards appear behind her.
“What the-“
The guards take her. But not to the exit.
 
## Chapter 27: A weird AI.
It’s 9 PM. Litz still hasn’t arrived yet. Clove is at the cave trying to track Shady Joe’s car, and Mello and Reqn are still at their shift. They are done at 10 PM.
Why is this running so slow? 
Clove sips his soda. Then he sees a command prompt window open up.
Hm?
“Hey.” That’s what the command prompt says.
Clove types back. “Hey?”
“That hologram nearby. I’m connected to it. It’s not on, so I’ve been on your computer.”
“You want me to turn it on?”
“Nooooo I wanted you to destroy it.”
“I can’t tell if that’s sarcasm.”
“It is. Can you turn it on?”
“Fine.”
Clove walks over to the hologram. He turns it on.
A little guy appears. He looks like he came from a low poly video game. “Wow. You have a rinky dinky place.”
“Thank you a lot.” Clove signs. He connects the hologram to a drone so that the person can walk around. “So how are you here?”
“It’s really a long story.”
“What even are you?”
“You know ChatGPT?”
“Yeah.”
“Well, whenever you type a prompt, I’m the one responding.”
“Well, if you really are ChatGPT, why was my computer running slow?”
“Sorry about that. I took up some power. Anyways, I’m Lil Guy.”
Clove goes over to his computer. “Cool, I guess.”
The Little Guy flies over to his computer. “Tracking something?”
“It’s also a long story. If you’re ChatGPT, go search the web or something. You’ll find out who I am.”
“Processing information.” Little Guy stays in a t-pose for a second. “Oh, you’re Clove Esqlende. Your friend is Mello.”
“And Litz and Reqn. I make stuff, if you couldn’t tell.”
“Coolio.”
“And uhh… my friend Litz isn’t responding to my texts.”
“…coolio?”
“No. Not coolio. That means something happened. And usually when something happens it’s not good.” Clove was typing.
“Well usually when someone stops texting David that’s a good thing-“
“Who the hell is David?”
“Some guy failing every class.”
“Okay, well, are you here to chat or assist?”
“Both.”
“Go pull up the security feeds. The Seattle lab.”
“Processing information.” Little guy went in a t-pose again. Then it opened a new tab of the live security feeds. “Green fish tail. That’s your friend, right?”
Clove nodded. “She’s being escorted by guards but I can’t tell where or why.”
“Me neither. Can’t get to the radio communications, so we can’t tell.”
“This is probably bad…”
At some point Litz got out of camera view. There were no cameras in where she is right now.
“Mello is definitely not going to be happy.” Clove signed.
“Is Mello your boss?”
“No, he’s a friend. I see him stare at Litz and daydream or something every once in a while.”
“Did he confess?”
“No, and when he does, he will probably do it very impulsively. That’s not the point though.”  Clove’s phone gets a notification. He opens it. It’s a scam text.
*Julia is 5 kilometers away from you! And she feels lonely…*
Clove types back.
*Shut it. I’m interested in someone else.*
He puts the phone aside. Then it dings again. It’s from the scam texter again.
*She’s in the containment room.
Clove thinks it’s a coincidence and tries not to show fear.
Good. I don’t care about Julia.
Julia is not in the containment room.
Who is in the containment room?
Litz.*
Meanwhile, Mello and Reqn was still in McDonalds. There wasn’t much people now. Mello’s alarm went off and he immediately took off his headset and apron. “We can go now.”
Reqn took off her apron and headset. “I think 64 dollars is nice for a job like this.”
“That’s nice. We just have to come back tomorrow and get our paycheck.” Mello walked out of the restaurant.
Reqn checks her imaginary phone. “Somebody texted me!”
“Who?”
“The evil guy!”
“…who’s the evil guy?”
“I defeat him while you guys are sleeping!”
“Why does ‘evil guy’ text you? You should probably block evil guy.”
“Yeah but evil guy is chill.”
“If evil guy is chill then why do you defeat him?”
“I defeat him… in sparring!”
“I want to see evil guy one day.” Mello says. Then he gets a call. He answers it. “Hello?”
Reqn is pretending to call evil guy.
Clove responds to Mello with his TTS. “Mello. We need to plan something quick. Litz is missing.”
Lil Guy can be heard in the background slightly. “Yeah, better do it now buddy!”
“Who was that?” Mello asks.
“Some AI that claims he’s ChatGPT. Just try to hurry.” He hangs up.
Mello sighs. “We need to move. Also, congrats. You are now in a rescue mission for the first time.”
Reqn is confused. “Wait, what?”
“Tell evil guy that he needs to wait. Litz is missing.”
They both start running.
“So how do these types of missions work?” Reqn asks.
“Simple. Kind of. You make a plan, consider any backfires, and execute the plan. These are usually stealth plans.”
“Sounds simple. Ish. Not really.”
They arrive at the cave.
“Where’s Litz?” Mello asks.
“I knew you’d say that.” Lil guy says.
“Who’s that?” Reqn asks.
“An AI. Probably.” Clove signs.
“Seriously though, where is she?” Mello asks.
“In the lab.”
“So how are we going to create the plan?”
Ghost Kitty gets some paper showing the floor plans.
Lil Guy floats over to the maps. “The place where your green friend is has no floor map. It’s secret.”
Clove stands up and walks over to the map. He grabs a random stick from the cave. “Litz is in the lower level, and we don’t have a keycard to get access.”
Lil Guy grabs a marker with the drone’s robotic arm. “This is where Litz was last seen. The cameras had a blind spot, and the hallway leads to 2 different pathways.”
“So I’m assuming we all go in different ways?” Reqn asks.
“Yeah.” Mello says.
“The real question is the keycard. To get to the lower level or even access the vents, we need a keycard.” Clove thinks for a while. “Normally I would have something to fake a keycard, but this lab is a little more serious, and I can’t tell if it would work without setting off the alarm.”
“On top of that, the reception desk checks in everybody. There’s no back door or window we can get through.” Mello says.
Reqn checks the files they have. “The only people allowed to go at this time are Wave, Will, Litz, and some other supervisors.”
“Cross out Litz. They probably revoked her access.” Lil Guy said.
Clove sighs. “This is going to be some planning.”
 
## Chapter 28: Another lab break in.
A couple of hours pass planning. Lil Guy was in the storage unit looking at the cameras, Mello, Clove, Reqn, and Ghost Kitty were near the entrance.
Clove pulls out one of his devices. “Let’s hope that-“
Something lands behind them.
Reqn immediately turns around.
It’s Wave. “Never seen you before.” She walks over calmly.
Clove takes a step back.
“I’m not here to capture you or anything.” She tosses her keycard to them.
Mello catches it. “Why give this?”
“This isn’t a good lab to work for. Now Litz is captured because she didn’t want to work on something bad. Eva was going to resign but they didn’t let her. And now I’m just going to send my resignation letter at home and ghost them.” Wave sighs. “Don’t think of this as a friendship or anything. Reception desk change is in about 20 minutes. That’s your window. My keycard will only get you through the entrance and elevator, everything else is biometrics. After that, it’s just you.” Wave walks away looking at the ground.
Reqn looks at the card. “Uhm, thank you…”
They wait for 20 minutes.
The person at reception; Lisa, eventually gets out, she’s probably switching.
“Go.” Clove enters the lab and quickly swipes the card next to the elevator.
The three enter.
Lil guy is tracking things. He notices something. “Get on top of the elevator. There’s tons of people waiting for the elevator down there. You should be able to enter the ventilation systems from there.”
Reqn scrambled onto the roof.
Mello climbed up next. “Watch your tail, there’s a lot of machinery here.”
Clove climbed up last and covered the hatch to the roof.
Multiple people walk into the elevator below them.
Reqn’s imaginary phone pretended to ding. “Not now evil guy…”
“Who’s evil guy?” Clove asks.
“Apparently she spars evil guy in the middle of the night while we are sleeping…”
Reqn puts her “phone” away.
The elevator stops.
“That’s your chance to get into the vents.”
The three enter the vents. It’s really cramped.
“I think we need to get to a different spot other than the vents, this is really cramped.” Reqn says.
Lil Guy sighs (not really, he’s an ai.)  “There’s a changing room nearby with lab coats. Go quick, you don’t want any unexpected… situations.”
Clove opens the vent grate. He checks the surroundings.
Nobody there.
He gets down. Reqn gets down next. Then Mello.
Clove passes the 2 some lab coats. Then he puts one on.
“My tail is still revealed…” Reqn says, looking back.
“I don’t know what to do about that, Litz never told me her secret to hide that.” Mello said. “Try to coil it around something.”
After a while, they finally got out of the changing room.
Lil Guy is typing (kind of). “Okay… so the next elevator is to your right. You need two keycards, different kinds.”
Mello sighs. “Where are we going to find that?”
They walked around for a while. Then they see Will walking with a clipboard in his hands.
Clove grabbed the keycard very swiftly. Then he turned around.
The other two didn’t notice he took it. They looked back at him. Then they caught up.
“Uhm… aren’t you going to get the keycard?” Reqn asked.
Clove looked around. Then he put both keycards into the elevator slot.
“What the hell? Where’d you get that from?” Reqn looked back at Will.
“No wonder my snacks kept disappearing…” Mello entered the elevator.
Lil Guy did a search of the floor plans. “This is the last part I can help you with. The next part has a retina scan. I can bypass it, luckily, but then the halls split into two. They never saved the floor plans for them, so I won’t be able to help. There are no security cameras in here either.”
“Dang.”
They entered the passage. There wasn’t anyone.
“Who’s going with who?” Mello said, putting his eye in front of the retina scan.
The door opens.
“I can go with Clove.” Reqn said.
“Cool, I can go with Ghost Kitty.” Mello said.
“Yeah, just say something when you find something.” Clove said.
They walked away.
Mello went to the left hallway with Ghost Kitty. “Anyone in this hallway Lil Guy?”
Lil Guy did a scan. “Doesn’t seem like-“
“Good.” Mello threw his lab coat off to the side. “That coat felt weird.”
He kept walking for some time. Then there was a door. It seemed to be locked. Mello was about to bash the door open, but then someone walked out. He sidestepped to the right.
It was Lisa. They were to distracted doing something on their phone, luckily.
Mello keeps the door open. Then he gets inside. “Nobody else here…” He looks around. There really is nobody here. Not even Litz. Mello sighs. He tries to open the door to get out again. It’s locked.
“Ohhhh no…”
Meanwhile, Clove and Reqn were walking down the hallway. “Do you think Mello found her yet?”
Clove shrugged.
They came across a door. It had a keypad in it.
Clove took out something from his pocket.
“What’s that?” Reqn asked.
“Hopefully not a bomb.” He places the thing onto the keypad.
It starts testing every combo rapidly. It eventually clicks at 371832
“Cool!” Reqn said.
Clove opened the door. He walked inside.
Reqn walks inside.
Litz was in a fish tank. Eva was in another. It seemed to be like a prison cell. But for fish.
“Why are they… there?” Reqn asked.
Clove shrugged. He signs to Litz. “Are these protected by alarms?”
Litz thought for a moment. Then she signed. “Breaking the tank isn’t protected, but if it goes through that drain it will trigger the alarm.”
Eva was waving at Clove happily.
Clove waved back, then looked at the drain. He covered it with duct tape. Then he grabbed a hammer from his toolbox. “Reqn, try to keep the door shut. We don’t want any noise to escape.”
Reqn presses against the door.
Clove shatters both glasses. The water begins to rush out.
Litz coughs. “Th-thanks.”
Eva walks around the place. “So where’s Mello?”
Reqn wonders. “Actually, I don’t know.”
Meanwhile, Mello is still trying anything to get the door open. 
“Doesn’t seem like it will budge.” Mello said.
Ghost Kitty appeared from the ceiling. It meowed.
Mello looked up. “What is it?”
It meows again. It points to the ceiling.
“…you want me to walk on the ceiling?”
It shakes it’s head. Then it phases back and through the ceiling.
“So… crawl on the ceiling?”
Ghost kitty meows.
Mello pulls over a chair and pushes a ceiling tile. He looks inside. “Crawl in this?”
Ghost kitty meows. It seems to be guiding Mello.
Mello is crawling through the ceiling now. After about a minute of crawling, Ghost Kitty phases back down through the ceiling. Mello pushes the ceiling tile away and drops down.
Mello shakes around for a bit. “A bit dusty up there, but thanks.” Mello runs through the hallway trying to catch up to Clove. He enters the same room the rest were in. “I’m finally back.”
“Why are you dusty?” Litz asks.
“I crawled through the ceiling.” Mello said awkwardly.
“The dust looks good on you!” Eva said, trying to compliment Mello but kind of failing.
“…thanks?”
Reqn looks around. “We should go now.”
Clove exits the room. He sneaks back to the elevator, and after some sneaking, they all make it outside the lab.
Eva jumps around. “Yayyyyy! We made it!”
Reqn sighs. “Yes. We did. And I missed my sparring session with evil guy! I promised evil guy!”
“Evil guy probably isn’t sleeping. We could probably spar evil guy.” Mello said jokingly.
“You’re right! Let’s go!”
Reqn sprints back to the cave like a cheetah with the rest barely keeping up. They eventually make it to the cave. Now Reqn is hitting the punching bag with her cardboard sword and shield.
“That’s evil guy?” Mello said.
“I expected him to be bigger.” Clove signed.
Eva is putting on makeup (even when it barely had an effect on her because she’s an eel). “Who’s evil guy?”
Litz is drying her hair. “Some random person Reqn spars at midnight every night. Or punching bag.”
 
## Chapter 29: The shadiest joe of the joes
It’s a new day. Eva is at her own apartment now, and Mello, Clove, Litz, and Reqn were planning.
“So we know Shady Joe’s car. That’s good. What’s not good is the fact that the license plates belongs to 4 different cars at once.” Clove says.
“4??? I thought it was only 1.” Mello looked at the computer.
“Do we each go to different cars?” Reqn asked.
“Probably not. We can just check the security footage of where all of those cars are.” Litz said.
“Processing information.” Lil Guy went in a t-pose. Then it dings. “From what I have found, the real Shady Joe is this one.” He opens a new tab in the computer.
Clove looks at the computer. “Oh, nice. It’s almost always in an abandoned warehouse.”
“That must be Shady Joe’s home!” Reqn said.
“Let’s go to Shady Joe’s home!” Litz said.
12 hours later… 10 PM…
Mello opened the abandoned warehouse. It was pretty big.
Clove signed. “From this point on, only whispering.”
The rest nodded.
They tiptoed around the place.
Litz found a computer. She opened it. It had no password. 
Mello walked over. “What is it?”
Litz pointed at the computer.
In the computer, all the announcements on Mello and Clove, all the warnings, all the alerts, all the bounties, they were all by Shady Joe. The first ever alarm to capture Mello and Clove was Shady Joe. Everything was by Shady Joe. 
Mello was shocked. Everything was Shady Joe. “Then why would the labs react to us?”
Litz did some typing. “He faked being the lab from Georgia. The emails he sent were alerts about it.” Litz read some more. “Will was blackmailed to capture me. He was forced to assign me that. He…” Litz was about to punch the computer from anger.
Reqn stopped her. “Don’t do that. It will make things worse.”
Litz took some deep breaths. “Fine…”
Clove took pictures of it from his phone.
Then gunshots were heard. They were warning shots. “Whoever is there… I won’t be hesitant.”
Shady Joe got down from the stairs. “You 3…4 now, huh?” Shady Joe aimed at them.
Clove grabbed a metal panel and aimed it at Shady Joe.
Shady Joe shot. It hit the metal panel.
Mello kicks the gun from his hand. “Why would you do this???”
Shady Joe grabs another gun from his pocket. “It’s all just business kid…” He shot, and barely missed Reqn.
Litz throws a nearby chair at him. “What business do you have to ruin Clove and Mello’s life???”
Shady Joe shoots through the chair. “Goals.”
Reqn tackles him. This time she pins him to the ground. “No goal requires this! What goal would you have to do this for???”
Shady Joe pushes her off of him and to the side. “Maybe next time you-“
Shady Joe got caught in his own trap. Now his leg is hanging upside down, and he’s in the air.
Reqn grabs the gun. Clove punches the gun out of Reqn’s hands. “What are you doing???”
Reqn looks at Clove with tears in her eyes. “He killed him!”
Clove sighs. “I know, but if you kill a killer, the amount of killers in the world stay the same. Doing this is just wrong, okay?”
Reqn leans onto Clove, her balance is uneasy right now.
Mello is calling 911 and explaining the situation.
Litz is transferring everything to a USB drive.
Some silence passes. The only thing you can hear are the crickets outside, sirens arriving, and Reqn quietly sobbing.
The police officers eventually arrive. They take Shady Joe into the police car.
“I always come back. One way or another.”
After 5 minutes, the police are gone now. They took the USB, and Reqn, Mello, Clove, and Litz are walking back. It’s mostly silent.
Mello is fidgeting around with his fidget spinner. “Well, that’s that. I think we did it.”
Litz sighs. “Yeah. Probably. I guess I can get my job back.”
“Should we watch his trial?” Clove asks.
“We would probably get called up as a witness. So yeah. I guess.” Reqn says.

## Chapter 30: Court Trial of Shady Joe
A day after the incident, 2 PM.
Mello sat next to Clove, Litz, and Reqn. They were all in the neatest clothes they could find, which wasn’t very neat at all.
The judge clears their throat. “Mr. ‘Shady Joe’, as you like to name yourself, you are charged with murder, attempted murder, impersonation, obstruction of justice, stalking, blackmail…”
Mello hears all the crimes. “That’s a long list.”
“Surprising. But not really at the same time.” Litz says.
The judge finishes the crime list. “How do you plead?”
“Not guilty.”
“The defense attorney is going to have a hard time trying to defend Shady Joe.” Reqn says.
“I would quit on the spot if I were the defense attorney.” Clove signed.
“Very well then.” The judge says.
The prosecutor calls up Clove for the first witness. “Please, state your name.”
Clove types their name. “Clove Esqlende.”
“Thank you. Please, state what happened in the warehouse at the time of the crime.”
Clove nods. “It was about 10 PM. Me and the rest of the group got inside the warehouse when-“
“So you broke in?” The defense asks.
Clove thinks. “The door wasn’t locked, so I believe it counts as trespassing.”
“That’s still a crime. This means you admit to trespassing.”
Clove rolls his eyes. “Yes, I, or we, admit. Please, let me continue.”
The defense nods.
“After we entered the warehouse, I went to see the supplies he had. He had mostly chemicals, and for some reason lots of candy. Then he fired a warning shot. He then-“
“Okay okay hold it. Did you take the candy?”
“No. I did not say that at all.”
Mello fidgets with his own fidget spinner. “I feel bad for the defense. He knows darn well Shady Joe is guilty and he’s trying to prove he isn’t.”
“Yeah, I don’t think there’s a way for Shady Joe to get out of this.” Reqn said.
Then the prosecution called up Litz as a witness. “Please, what did you see from your perspective?”
Litz adjusts her glasses. “Well, after Mello opened the doors, I went inside near Mello. I found a computer and decided to open it to-“
“So you breached the password?” The defense asked.
“No, it didn’t have a password at all-“
“How are we supposed to believe that?”
“You can check the computer. Anyways, when I opened the computer, all the files found related to the crime are in this USB.” Litz held up the USB.
“How are we supposed to know it’s not fabricated?”
“Everything is verified.” The judge said.
The defense sat down. “No further questions…”
“I would like to call up Reqn Em for the next witness. This time, she will be talking about the death of Joe.”
Reqn sighed. “So… me, Mello, and Litz were walking back from Target after buying Up. And then a van appeared, Shady Joe asked us for candy. We said no, but then he tried to ram us with his-“
“How can you prove he tried to run you over with a van?”
Reqn thinks. “We… uhhh…”
The defense stood up happily. Not that Shady Joe is cleared, obviously, but because he has something to work with. “You honor! The witness has no way to prove that he tried to run them over with a van!”
“Sustained.”
Reqn sighs. “May I continue?”
“You may.”
Reqn thinks. “So then after that, Shady Joe gets out of his van and tries to shoot us, but then I tackled him, but then he through me off of him and then… I went unconcious.”
“How do we know that you went unconcious.”
Reqn thinks. “I hit my head… I think I have a bruise of it.” She tries to uncover much of her hair. The defendant leans over to see it. There is a noticable bruise.
The defense slumps back. “No further questions.”
The prosecutor nods. “You can go now, Reqn.”
“Thank you.” Reqn steps off.
“I would now like to call Mello Cilla.”
Mello steps up to the witness box.
“Now, I would like to ask you about most events that have happened. The cruise incident, the riot chasing you, and the death of Joe. I apologize, but this might take a little bit of time.”
Mello nods. “I understand.”
“Can you first explain the cruise incident?”
“Well, there isn’t really much to say. It was about 10 PM, and I was walking around the ship, then the ship hit something, and then I got thrown off the boat.”
The defense stands. It’s clear he has no hope in this case. “Y-your honor, this testimony is far too short!”
The judge sighs. They feel bad for the defense. “Overruled.”
“Now, can you explain the major riot that happened on October, 12?”
Mello mumbles. “October 12… oh yeah that thing!” Mello clears his throat. “Well, me and Clove were walking back from the shop near the café, when I saw a billboard of our bounty! The entire crowd near us started chasing us! We went up through the fire escape and escaped them somehow.”
“No questions…” The defense says, his eyes closed in his seat.
“Can we hear your testimony about the murder of Joe?”
Mello gulped. “So… it was as Reqn listed. He tried to run us over with his van, almost shot us, then after Reqn went unconsious, he pulled out another gun and threatened me. Then Joe fired a warning shot, but Shady Joe shot him. Litz fainted from shock, and he fled the scene.”
“No questions…”
The prosecutor nods. “Thank you. You may go now.”
“Thanks.” Mello walks away.
“Would you like to suggest anything, defense?”
He slumps back. “No.”
It doesn’t take long for the jury to come back.
The judge reads the verdict. “Guilty on all charges.”
 
## Chapter 31 (not really a chapter): Epilogue
Mello starts recording on the CD.
He coughs. “Hello… whoever reads this CD! I’m Mello Cilla, and this is a time capsule. I know you might not be able to read this, because CDs are probably old school, but it’s worth documenting what has happened over some time. It’s been an entire year since Shady Joe was arrested, and over that time, things have changed! A lot! For starters, Litz got a promotion! Now she can invite people over, like me and Clove! Oh, and speaking of Clove, he’s dating Reqn right now! He’s over by the movie theater at the time of this recording. Also, now the bill to let other fish… people… I dunno how to refer to them… well, they did say they’re called hybrids… okay forget the fact you heard that last part. They allowed hybrids to come over to American land! It’s not often you see other fish people, but you do get to see them at least once a day. Some people are still getting used to seeing fish people… and I don’t think some will get used to it at all… but earlier, they did make a law on it. So they’re still forming, I guess. Eva sends postcards a lot. Last time it was from Hawaii. So that’s neat. Ghost Kitty comes around often, it seems to have some collection of stuff that he found. His newest addition is a pocketwatch from 1970. They also made a plaque for Joe, the one who died. Some people leave flowers, others leave candy, it’s a whole thing, to be honest. I also go to online school now! It doesn’t seem like Ghost Kitty likes it when I go to school, because he keeps trying to block the camera on my laptop. Anyways, this CD is running out of space, so I’m just going to leave it there. Hopefully whoever finds this I get to meet you. Bye!!! Also this was recorded on November-“
The CD cuts off.

The end.

…right?
